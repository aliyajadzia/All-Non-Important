1
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:48,096
（依撒意亞 40:28）或者沒有聽說：
<i>Have you not heard?</i>

2
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:53,180
上主是永生的天主，是創造地極之主
<i>The Lord is the everlasting God,
the Creator of the ends of the Earth.</i>

3
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:58,056
祂總不疲倦，絕不困乏
<i>He will not grow tired or weary,</i>

4
00:01:58,145 --> 00:02:01,024
祂的智慧高深莫測
<i>and His understanding
no one can fathom.</i>

5
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:09,983
（依撒意亞 40:29）祂賜給疲倦者力量，賜給無力者勇氣
<i>He gives strength to the weary
and increases the power of the weak.</i>

6
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:15,744
（依撒意亞 40:30）少年人能疲倦困乏，青年人能失足跌倒；
<i>Even youths grow tired and weary,
and young men stumble and fall.</i>

7
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:20,058
（依撒意亞 40:31）而仰望上主的，必獲得新力量
<i>But those who hope in the Lord
will renew their strength.</i>

8
00:02:22,545 --> 00:02:25,140
必能展翅高飛有如兀鷹
<i>They will soar on wings like eagles.</i>

9
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:28,024
疾馳而不困乏
<i>They will run and not grow weary.</i>

10
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:30,859
奔走而不疲倦
<i>They will walk and not be faint.</i>

11
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:35,624
多斯，堅持住！
Desmond, hang on!

12
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:39,135
堅持住，多斯！
Hang on, Desmond!

13
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,263
我們正在把你弄出去！
We're going to get you out of here!

14
00:02:56,625 --> 00:03:00,096
多斯。多斯！
Desmond. Desmond!

15
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:01,735
什麼？
What?

16
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:04,818
等一等 接住
Wait up. Catch up.

17
00:03:04,905 --> 00:03:07,261
等一等 我有些事情要告訴你
Wait up, I've got something to tell you.

18
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:12,140
是什麼 哈爾
What, Hal?

19
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:14,659
和你比一比誰能最先登頂
Race you to the top.

20
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:16,338
嘿 你作弊
Hey! Cheater!

21
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:29,383
晚點見 慢吞吞的傢伙 嘿
See you later, slowpoke. Hey!

22
00:03:35,185 --> 00:03:37,654
需要搭把手 抓住了
Want a hand? I got it.

23
00:03:43,825 --> 00:03:45,179
坐下 啊 你個笨蛋
Sit down! Ah, you dope!

24
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:46,665
你退出吧 你先退出
Quit it. You quit it.

25
00:03:51,705 --> 00:03:53,617
看在皮特的份上
For Pete's sake.

26
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:56,982
嘿 離開那個窗台 你個蠢孩子
Hey! Get away from that ledge, you damn fool kids!

27
00:03:57,065 --> 00:03:58,658
你會折斷你的脖子的
You're going to break your necks!

28
00:03:59,945 --> 00:04:03,734
這是多斯他們的孩子 和他們的老爹一樣瘋狂
It's them Doss kids. Crazy as their old man.

29
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:16,102
他們挖開了傑克遜和美因的角落
They dug up the corner of Jackson and Main...

30
00:04:17,945 --> 00:04:19,777
放在了人行道上
Putting in a sidewalk...

31
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:24,857
你們這些男孩現在不會認得了
You boys wouldn't recognize it now.

32
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:34,335
不好意思 我懷疑他們還能不能認出你
Mind you, I doubt they'd recognize you.

33
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:40,222
當我經過他們身邊時 他們幾乎不認識我
They hardly know me when I walk by 'em.

34
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:44,736
就像是我和你一起死了
It's like I died with you.

35
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:53,065
就像是我們從未存在過
It's like we boys never existed.

36
00:05:01,705 --> 00:05:04,425
好了 就這麼多
Well, that's all I got for you today.

37
00:05:24,785 --> 00:05:27,619
用你的右手擋住他 多斯
Block him with your right, Desmond.

38
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,897
停手 你聽到我說的話了嗎
Stop it! Do you hear me?

39
00:05:30,985 --> 00:05:32,127
你們為什麼要打架
What are they fighting about?

40
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,705
他們什麼時候需要過原因
When'd they ever need a reason?

41
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:35,777
湯姆 呸
Tom! Ugh!

42
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:37,936
為什麼要阻止他們 如果不阻止的話我就不用鞭打他們兩個了
Why stop 'em? Saves me whipping them both.

43
00:05:38,025 --> 00:05:39,857
這邊走 我只打贏了的那個
This way, I just whip the one that wins.

44
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,415

湯姆 醒醒 你能聽見我說話嗎
Tom! Wake up, can you hear me?

48
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:51,981

What the hell have you done?

49
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:53,255
他聽不見我
He can't hear me.

50
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:58,302
我去拿些冰塊來
I'll get some ice.

51
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:03,864
你把那個籃子拿開 好了
You shift that basket. I got it.

52
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:06,338

Is he breathing?

53
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:09,465
哈爾 哈爾 你能聽見我嗎

哈爾 挺住
Hal... Come on.

56
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:27,104
他膨脹了
He's dilated.

57
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:28,901
哈爾
Hal...

58
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:54,175
你以為你在做什麼
What do you think you're doin'?

59
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:59,340
我現在要打你了 你明白規矩的
I'm gonna have to beat you now, you know the rules.

60
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,895
聽見我說話了嗎 多斯
You hear me, Desmond?

61
00:07:05,065 --> 00:07:07,500
多斯 湯姆 停手
Desmond! Tom, stop.

62
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:09,417
你準備怎麼教導那個男孩
What's that gonna teach the boy?

63
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:11,940
他已經足夠暴力了
He's violent enough already.

64
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:14,460
行 好吧 那你用親吻的方式來溺愛他吧
Okay, fine, you go smother him in kisses.

65
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:18,095
你告訴他這是一個溫柔且文雅的世界
You tell him the world's a soft and gentle place.

66
00:07:22,225 --> 00:07:24,057
哈爾會沒事的
Hal's gonna be okay.

67
00:07:35,665 --> 00:07:36,894

剛剛我可能會失手殺了他 是 你確實會失手殺了他
I could have killed him. Yes, you could have.

69
00:07:45,225 --> 00:07:48,024
謀殺 這是最嚴重的罪孽
Murder, it's the worst sin of all.

70
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:49,585
而取人性命
And to take another man's life,

71
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:53,375
是上主眼中最壞的罪孽
that is the most egregious sin in the Lord's sight.

72
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:57,300
沒有其他事情能夠傷害他的心這麼嚴重
Nothing hurts his heart so much.

73
00:07:57,425 --> 00:07:58,745
你聽不明白人話嗎
Don't you understand English?

74
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,183
我還需要再告訴你一次嗎
Do I have to tell you again?

You mind your own damned business!

78

去睡覺吧 湯姆
Go sleep it off, Tom.

79
00:08:10,945 --> 00:08:12,265
我恨他
I hate him.

80
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:28,865
媽媽
Momma?

81
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:32,335
哦

Why does he hate us so much?

83
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:47,540
噢 他不恨我們
Oh, he don't hate us.

84
00:08:49,745 --> 00:08:53,056
他有時候會恨他自己
He hates himself sometimes.

85
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:57,339
你今天晚上的爸爸並不是真正的他
Your daddy tonight, that ain't the real him.

86
00:08:58,545 --> 00:09:02,585
我希望你像我一樣了解一戰前的他
I wish you knew him like I did, before the war.

87
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:04,065
（榮歸天父歌）讚美主
<i># Praise the Lord</i>

88
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,502

我們聽起來怎麼樣 多斯
How'd we sound, Desmond?

95
00:09:27,065 --> 00:09:29,341
像天上的天使一樣 媽媽
Like a heavenly host of angels, Mom.

96
00:09:29,425 --> 00:09:33,101
現在 你知道說謊也是一種罪孽 尤其是在這種地方
Now, you know it's a sin to tell a lie, especially in this place.

97
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:35,780
好吧 我從來沒說過他們是歌唱天使
Well, I ain't never said they were singing angels.

98
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:43,381
那裡發生了什麼 多斯
What's going on out there? Desmond!

99
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:45,502

我會叫一輛救護車
I'll phone an ambulance.

102

00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:29,497
壓住這個地方 你們用了止血帶了嗎

110
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:30,701
是的 醫生 做得很好
Yes, sir. Nice work.

111
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:32,265
你們可能救了這個男孩的生命
You might have saved this boy's life.

Stay with us, you're gonna be okay.

117
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:45,581
You feel pain?

118
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:51,497
Stay with us, okay?

119
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:52,940
Army physicals that way.
This is for giving blood.

120
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,660
Are you all right?

121
00:12:02,385 --> 00:12:05,163
Oh, no, that's not mine. I'm fine.

122
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:08,222
Thank you for asking though,
ma'am.

123
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:13,821
What do you need?

124
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:18,503
My belt.

125
00:12:21,185 --> 00:12:24,064
I lent it to the boy
who had the accident.

126
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:26,182
My pants don't hold
up so good without it.

127
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:30,305
Well, uh, I don't have your belt.

128
00:12:30,385 --> 00:12:31,944
No, I know that, ma'am. It's out there.

129
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:33,425
It's right out there with the boy still.

130
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:38,222
Okay. I'm just here to take blood.

131
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:41,059
I'll give mine.

132
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:44,217
Okay, go to that room over
there and wait with the others.

133
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,705
I'll call you.

134
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:52,264
That room.

135
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:02,256
You ever given blood before,
Mr...

136
00:13:04,425 --> 00:13:05,541
Doss.

137
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,340
But my friends call me Desmond.
No, ma'am, this is my first time.

138
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:23,819
I always dreamed about being a doctor.
But, uh, I didn't get much school.

139
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:28,694
You may be a little
dizzy when we're done.

140
00:13:28,785 --> 00:13:31,300
Is somebody picking you up?

141
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,581
No, ma'am. Walking back.

142
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:35,463
Where do you live?

143
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:36,865
Fort Hill, ma'am.

144
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:38,544
That's a ways.

145
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:42,938
No. Just five or six miles,
but I cut through the woods.

146
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,017
It's seven that way!

147
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:47,381
You must really like the woods.

148
00:13:47,465 --> 00:13:49,457
Yes, ma'am. I sure do.

149
00:13:49,545 --> 00:13:51,502
Okay, put some pressure here.

150
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,302
- You okay?
- Yeah.

151
00:13:58,345 --> 00:13:59,495
Bye.

152
00:13:59,985 --> 00:14:03,183
Where you going
looking all spruced and nice?

153
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:06,144
Met someone yesterday.
A nurse over at the hospital.

154
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:07,745
Her name's Dorothy Schutte.
I'm gonna marry her.

155
00:14:07,825 --> 00:14:09,737
Goodness. Does she know that?

156
00:14:09,825 --> 00:14:11,737
Well, not yet.
She's about to.

157
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:15,944
You ever even spoken to a woman?
I mean, one that's not family.

158
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:18,455
Spoke to her.

159
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:20,741
Well, in that case,
come give your brother a big hug.

160
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,179
- Hal!
- Come here.

161
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:23,984
Keep your greasy paws off of me.

162
00:14:25,505 --> 00:14:26,621
Wish me luck, Momma.

163
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:28,575
Good luck.

164
00:15:05,665 --> 00:15:07,019
Next.

165
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:10,257
Grab a seat.
You ever given blood before?

166
00:15:10,345 --> 00:15:11,381
Yes, ma'am. I have.

167
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:16,297
You're the belt man.

168
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:17,899
Desmond, yes, ma'am.

169
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:20,784
Well, Desmond, we can't
take your blood two days in a row.

170
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:22,822
Well, that's good.
I came to get mine back.

171
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:25,261
- You what?
- My blood. I need it back.

172
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:29,420
Well, it don't work like that,
we can't just give it back to you.

173
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:31,576
Well, you got to.

174
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:35,336
Ever since you stuck me with that needle,
my heart's been beating real fast.

175
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:37,701
Every time I think about you,
it beats faster still.

176
00:15:39,825 --> 00:15:42,818
I never heard that one before.
It's pretty corny.

177
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:44,937
It is?

178
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:48,302
That's a shame,
I done practiced that all night.

179
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:49,421
No good?

180
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:53,538
I didn't say that.

181
00:16:13,425 --> 00:16:16,259
What's the difference
between an artery and a vein?

182
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,743
- What are you talking about?
- The boy's accident.

183
00:16:24,105 --> 00:16:25,539
Arteries spurt blood.

184
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:29,025
And veins?

185
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:31,421
Bleed.

186
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:35,895
I think you need to practice

187
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:38,819
your boy/girl dating talk
at home before you come out.

188
00:16:38,905 --> 00:16:40,737
Yeah, I probably do.

189
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:44,536
I'll give you a book
if you're that interested.

190
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:47,420
On dating?

191
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:50,462
On blood.

192
00:16:58,945 --> 00:17:01,619
Another medical question perhaps?

193
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:05,016
No. I just think you're the
prettiest thing I ever seen.

194
00:17:06,585 --> 00:17:08,656
That's because I'm sitting in the dark.

195
00:17:11,745 --> 00:17:15,739
No, you're just beautiful.

196
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,298
Out of the way!

197
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:46,182
You need to watch where you're going.

198
00:17:58,105 --> 00:17:59,778
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd mind.

199
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:02,015
You didn't ask.

200
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:05,047
I thought you might
have liked it.

201
00:18:05,247 --> 00:18:07,015
Well,
I might have if you'd asked.

202
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:18,821
You coming?

203
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,264
Watch where you're walking!

204
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:46,464
Why didn't you say nothing to us?

205
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:48,417
'Cause you would have tried
and talked me out of it,

206
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,777
- and I know what I'm doing is right.
- And what about His Commandment?

207
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,824
It's not killing in a war.
It's protecting.

208
00:18:54,905 --> 00:18:56,703
Loads of boys from our church are going.

209
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:59,823
- Yeah.
- There is a war and they need men.

210
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,261
And working in a paper mill
ain't going to save this country.

211
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:15,423
Looks like a movie star, our boy.

212
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:22,064
Nice uniform, good hat.

213
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:28,664
Reminds me of how Artie Giddens looked
in his uniform when we went to France.

214
00:19:30,785 --> 00:19:32,378
- Remember him, Bertha?
- Don't, Tom.

215
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,541
What?

216
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:39,743
I'm just saying how snappy
Artie looked in his uniform.

217
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:42,499
All you girls
certainly seemed to think so.

218
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:45,544
He had them flocking to him.
He was most proud.

219
00:19:51,545 --> 00:19:53,343
I just hope that when our Hal gets shot,

220
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,940
it's through the front of his jacket.

221
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:59,143
Like a simple entry wound, not much mess.

222
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,024
Artie got hit in the back,

223
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:05,657
it blew most of his guts and intestines
out his front, offal everywhere.

224
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:10,141
Wrecked his uniform entirely.

225
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:15,539
It was lucky he was dead,

226
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:18,982
so he never knew
how awful his uniform looked.

227
00:20:23,705 --> 00:20:25,264
Get outta of my sight.

228
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,343
What are you, part mountain goat?

229
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:30,901
Are you going to help me, Desmond Doss,

230
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:32,817
or are you just going
to leave me stranded?

231
00:21:37,225 --> 00:21:39,899
I'll help you, but it's gonna cost you.

232
00:21:39,985 --> 00:21:41,055
What?

233
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:42,615
A kiss.

234
00:21:45,185 --> 00:21:48,019
- That is pure blackmail.
- Well, yes, ma'am, it is.

235
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:50,062
But that is still my condition.

236
00:21:52,825 --> 00:21:56,739
That's the deal.
And I'm going to hold you to it.

237
00:22:09,905 --> 00:22:11,703
Well, hold on now.

238
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:15,937
You ain't gonna slap me, are you?

239
00:22:16,025 --> 00:22:18,381
'Cause I fall off,
I'm going to take you with me.

240
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:20,738
Kiss me and find out.

241
00:23:09,785 --> 00:23:10,775
What?

242
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:13,983
I have to enlist.

243
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,780
I can't stay here while
all of them go fight for me.

244
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:20,699
- Yes, you can. You can stay here.
- Dorothy, I have to.

245
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:22,458
I want to be a medic.

246
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:24,741
I figure I'll be saving people,
not killing them.

247
00:23:28,785 --> 00:23:31,061
I have to go to work.
I'm going to be late.

248
00:23:34,065 --> 00:23:37,695
Dorothy. Dorothy, darling.
Dorothy. Dorothy!

249
00:23:41,145 --> 00:23:43,137
So are you going to ask me
to marry you or what?

250
00:23:45,745 --> 00:23:47,543
Well, I don't know.
You still going to have me?

251
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:50,777
Well, I wouldn't know, you haven't asked.

252
00:23:50,865 --> 00:23:55,496
Well, I'm asking you,
with all my heart and then some.

253
00:23:55,585 --> 00:23:59,625
- Will you marry me?
- Then, yes. Yes, I will.

254
00:24:09,385 --> 00:24:10,785
When?

255
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:12,299
Soon as you get your first leave.

256
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:14,536
But I still don't like you at this moment.

257
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:16,663
- Yeah.
- Okay.

258
00:24:16,745 --> 00:24:19,180
Okay. Well, I love you.

259
00:24:19,265 --> 00:24:21,382
Shh!

260
00:24:32,465 --> 00:24:34,934
Momma said come see you here.

261
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:36,095
Yeah.

262
00:24:40,185 --> 00:24:42,461
These three were my best friends.

263
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:46,294
I grew up with 'em,

264
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:48,104
I got into trouble with 'em,
chased girls with 'em.

265
00:24:49,385 --> 00:24:50,614
And I enlisted with 'em.

266
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:55,182
Now my friends are there,

267
00:24:56,785 --> 00:24:59,937
covered in dirt and grass
and eaten by worms.

268
00:25:02,865 --> 00:25:04,777
I don't want to have
to visit my sons here.

269
00:25:06,265 --> 00:25:08,860
Daddy, I signed up already.

270
00:25:11,825 --> 00:25:16,297
I couldn't do otherwise, Pop.
Everybody else is doing...

271
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:18,058
You ain't everybody else!

272
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:23,298
Everybody else jumps in
and does things quick, without thinking!

273
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:27,140
Like the damn idiot fools we were.

274
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,945
And soldiers who live,
they live because they can do that!

275
00:25:30,025 --> 00:25:31,618
You can't!

276
00:25:32,145 --> 00:25:35,980
Look, you gotta sit
and think and pray about everything.

277
00:25:36,065 --> 00:25:39,024
I mean, look at you,
you're doing it right now.

278
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:41,176
You won't be able
to live with yourself if you go.

279
00:25:41,265 --> 00:25:43,257
No, I won't be able
to live with myself if I don't.

280
00:25:43,345 --> 00:25:47,305
I'm going to be a medic.
That's going to be my way to serve.

281
00:25:47,385 --> 00:25:50,264
See, there you go, thinking it all out.

282
00:25:50,385 --> 00:25:55,744
What, you figure this war is just
going to fit in with you, your ideas?

283
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:58,101
Well, I don't doubt it's going to be hard.

284
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:02,858
It won't be hard, it'll be impossible.

285
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:06,734
You know, whatever beliefs you have
in your crazy head now,

286
00:26:06,825 --> 00:26:09,977
they won't ever play out.
It don't work that way.

287
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:13,058
And if by some, I don't know,
miracle chance you survive,

288
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:15,899
you won't be giving no thanks to God.

289
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:21,734
- Ready?
- Ready.

290
00:26:21,825 --> 00:26:22,861
Y'all need some air.

291
00:26:22,945 --> 00:26:24,902
Come on, fellas, shake a leg.
Uncle Sam's got you now.

292
00:26:24,985 --> 00:26:28,376
Say goodbye to Momma. Come on.

293
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:30,861
Ladies, please, step away from the bus.

294
00:26:30,945 --> 00:26:33,744
- I almost forgot. Here.
- Do I need a crowbar?

295
00:26:34,465 --> 00:26:37,503
I want you to have this. It's mine.

296
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:42,936
You keep it right here, where I'll be.

297
00:26:47,345 --> 00:26:49,382
- Bye.
- Bye.

298
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:55,018
I love you.

299
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:34,502
Hey, don't say that about my girl.

300
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:36,144
- What else...
- Hey. Oh.

301
00:27:36,225 --> 00:27:38,535
Hey. Sorry, pal.

302
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:40,582
...means you're the person.

303
00:27:41,465 --> 00:27:44,981
- They got me a bum steer.
- Nah, it's just a bum.

304
00:27:45,065 --> 00:27:48,024
Do I have to gaze at your deformity
every time I walk to my bed?

305
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:50,745
Gaze upon it in envy, my friend.

306
00:27:52,345 --> 00:27:56,942
You okay there?
You look lost. Vacancy right here.

307
00:27:57,025 --> 00:28:00,462
Wise choice. It's got views of
the mountains down to the lake.

308
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:01,740
Randall Fuller.

309
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:04,784
Desmond Doss.

310
00:28:04,865 --> 00:28:07,824
Call him "Teach." No one
understands a word he says.

311
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:09,703
That's because no one else here can read.

312
00:28:09,785 --> 00:28:13,017
The testicles there belong to a man
calling himself "Hollywood."

313
00:28:13,105 --> 00:28:15,540
They look like they belong
to a smaller guy.

314
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,218
You know testicles.

315
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:22,295
Oh! Hey, I just got these shoes.

316
00:28:22,385 --> 00:28:25,583
Hey, uh, Grease Nolan, outta Red Hook.
Where you from?

317
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:27,344
- Virginia.
- Ooh, hillbilly, huh?

318
00:28:27,425 --> 00:28:31,180
You marry your first cousin?
I'm just joking.

319
00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:33,221
Whoa!

320
00:28:33,305 --> 00:28:35,456
That's Smitty over there,
whipping Kirzinski's ass.

321
00:28:35,545 --> 00:28:36,945
Like you were doing
any better, chowder head.

322
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:38,539
Hey, I didn't want to embarrass you.

323
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,582
Wal Kirzinski, nice to meet you.

324
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:43,624
Hey, beanpole,
what did you say your name was?

325
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:44,934
Desmond Doss.

326
00:28:47,385 --> 00:28:50,298
That's Tex Lewis over there,
he thinks he's some kind of cowboy.

327
00:28:50,385 --> 00:28:54,095
And, uh, Vito Rinnelli.
He may be small, but he is a bulldog.

328
00:28:54,185 --> 00:28:55,460
- Hey.
- How you doing?

329
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:57,138
- Desmond.
- Yeah.

330
00:28:57,225 --> 00:28:58,978
This handsome guy
right here is Lucky Ford.

331
00:28:59,065 --> 00:29:00,055
Hey.

332
00:29:00,145 --> 00:29:03,058
That's Walker and Pinnick over there
pretending they're card sharks.

333
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:04,545
Pipe down, Grease, all right?

334
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:06,776
Unless you want to
put your money where your mouth is.

335
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:12,579
Oh, hey, the old good book, right?

336
00:29:12,665 --> 00:29:15,305
I think Lucky's got a good book.

337
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:17,536
- Right, Lucky?
- It's a good read.

338
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:21,136
Attention!

339
00:29:22,545 --> 00:29:24,025
Line up! Move it!

340
00:29:24,105 --> 00:29:26,461
Let's go, move it. Move it.

341
00:29:56,305 --> 00:29:58,262
You are a very strange-looking individual

342
00:29:58,345 --> 00:30:00,143
if you don't mind me saying so, Private.

343
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:02,421
- Name?
- Andy Walker.

344
00:30:02,505 --> 00:30:04,178
How long have you been dead, son?

345
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:06,656
- Sir?
- I am not "Sir"!

346
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:11,615
I am Sergeant Howell or Sarge.
"Sir" you save for useless people.

347
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,777
- The name is "Ghoul," you say?
- Walker, Sergeant!

348
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:19,141
- Ghoul it is.
- Yes, Sergeant!

349
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:37,419
There's something off
in your presentation, Private.

350
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,343
Can't place it.

351
00:30:40,185 --> 00:30:41,539
Is it your hair?

352
00:30:42,785 --> 00:30:45,175
Is it the wrinkle in your trousers?

353
00:30:45,305 --> 00:30:46,500
I have a knife in my foot, Sergeant.

354
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:51,415
Oh, yes, of course, that's it. The knife.

355
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:53,337
- What is your name, soldier?
- Smitty Ryker.

356
00:30:53,425 --> 00:30:57,135
No, your name is Private Idiot.
Do you know why?

357
00:30:57,225 --> 00:31:00,104
- Because I have a knife in my foot.
- Who placed the knife there, Private?

358
00:31:00,185 --> 00:31:01,824
It was an accident, Sarge.
We was playing Stretch.

359
00:31:01,945 --> 00:31:05,143
I am heartened by the knowledge you
did not place it there with intention.

360
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:08,059
Who threw the knife?

361
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:11,377
I did, Sergeant. Private Kirzinski.

362
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:15,175
You look part Indian.
To what tribe do you belong, son?

363
00:31:15,265 --> 00:31:16,585
No, I'm Polish.

364
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:19,863
Wrong. I believe you must have
Cherokee or Shawnee blood in you.

365
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,664
- No, Sergeant.
- Are you contradicting me,

366
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:24,419
- you wagon-burning son of a bitch?
- No, Sergeant!

367
00:31:24,505 --> 00:31:26,417
Let me see your Indian war cry, son.

368
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:27,621
I don't...

369
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,422
Louder! Let me see it.

370
00:31:32,465 --> 00:31:35,299
What is your animal spirit?
Are you a garter snake?

371
00:31:35,385 --> 00:31:36,819
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a chipmunk?

372
00:31:36,905 --> 00:31:39,374
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you a dancing reindeer?

373
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,696
- No, Sergeant!
- Are you contradicting me, Private?

374
00:31:41,785 --> 00:31:44,425
- No, Sergeant!
- Good.

375
00:31:44,505 --> 00:31:46,656
Then I shall henceforth call you "Chief"

376
00:31:46,745 --> 00:31:48,976
as a sign of great respect to your people.

377
00:31:50,345 --> 00:31:51,495
Thank you, Sergeant!

378
00:31:53,505 --> 00:31:55,736
Are you grinning at me, boy,
or is that your natural state?

379
00:31:55,825 --> 00:31:56,815
No, Sergeant.

380
00:31:56,905 --> 00:31:59,101
- Name, Private?
- Desmond Doss.

381
00:31:59,185 --> 00:32:01,780
I have seen stalks of corn
with better physiques.

382
00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:04,255
Makes me want to pull an ear off, Private.

383
00:32:04,345 --> 00:32:06,382
- Can you carry your weight?
- Yes, Sergeant!

384
00:32:06,465 --> 00:32:08,616
Should be easy for you, then.

385
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:09,900
- Corporal.
- Sergeant.

386
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:12,216
Make sure you keep this man
away from strong winds.

387
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,375
Yes, Sergeant.

388
00:32:15,865 --> 00:32:17,618
- Private Idiot.
- Yes, Sergeant.

389
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:19,981
Raise your foot. Higher.

390
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:25,544
Everyone outside. Now! Move it.

391
00:32:27,465 --> 00:32:28,581
I said move it.

392
00:32:28,665 --> 00:32:30,099
All right.
Just getting in my uniform, Sarge.

393
00:32:30,185 --> 00:32:32,780
- Did I ask him to, Corporal?
- No memory of it, Sarge.

394
00:32:32,865 --> 00:32:36,302
I believe any man who takes
such pride in his natural naked state

395
00:32:36,385 --> 00:32:38,695
will surely enjoy
the brisk of the outdoors.

396
00:32:38,785 --> 00:32:41,823
Now move your privates, Private Parts!

397
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:45,899
Move it! You son of an exhibitionist!

398
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:50,222
I am going to teach you
how to tie a bowline knot,

399
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:53,463
so you can get your sorry asses
down from a height,

400
00:32:53,545 --> 00:32:55,662
so I may then kick them!

401
00:32:55,745 --> 00:32:58,817
Create a loop. This is the rabbit hole.

402
00:32:58,905 --> 00:33:02,535
The rabbit comes out of his hole,
runs around the tree,

403
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:07,256
goes back into the hole.
All right, let's go!

404
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:11,018
Very good, Tex.

405
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:13,860
Keep struggling, Teach.

406
00:33:13,945 --> 00:33:15,459
Have you ever roped a goat, Hollywood?

407
00:33:16,345 --> 00:33:17,461
No, Sarge.

408
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:19,218
Have you ever looked into a goat's eyes?

409
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:20,819
- No, Sarge.
- Good, that would be unnatural.

410
00:33:23,425 --> 00:33:25,064
You know if you don't breathe, you'll die.

411
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:28,502
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good, Private Idiot.

412
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:34,705
Congratulations, Greaseball, you just
fell 50 feet and broke your neck!

413
00:33:36,025 --> 00:33:38,540
Brilliant, Private Vito Rinnelli.

414
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:41,220
You strangled yourself, numb nuts!

415
00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:43,058
- Are you a fan of Benito?
- No, Sergeant.

416
00:33:43,145 --> 00:33:46,297
A bit taller.
If you were American, you'd be taller.

417
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:54,705
What've we got here, Doss,
one for each titty?

418
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:58,455
You were tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra!

419
00:34:00,785 --> 00:34:03,505
- What is so funny, Corporal?
- Couldn't tell you, Sergeant.

420
00:34:05,985 --> 00:34:09,183
Come on! Come on, ladies,
pick it up! Move it! Move it!

421
00:34:09,265 --> 00:34:11,905
I want to see some fire here.
A little hustle.

422
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:13,385
Show me something!

423
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:14,660
Run like you mean it!

424
00:34:14,745 --> 00:34:17,499
- Down, down, down! Faster, faster!
- Come on. Move it! Move it!

425
00:34:17,585 --> 00:34:20,100
Let's go, it's bath time, boys!
It's bath time!

426
00:34:21,465 --> 00:34:23,297
Move! Move! Move!

427
00:34:23,385 --> 00:34:25,456
I want to see you work. Let's go!

428
00:34:25,545 --> 00:34:27,184
Dig, dig, dig!

429
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,734
Don't forget behind your ears.
Let's go. Move!

430
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:33,501
I bet you're enjoying this,
you naked degenerate.

431
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:36,783
Let's go! Hustle. Hustle. Hustle. Move!

432
00:34:38,345 --> 00:34:42,976
Let's go! What are we waiting on?
Let's go! Move your ass!

433
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:46,024
Get the wood! Get the wall!
Don't get splinters!

434
00:34:46,105 --> 00:34:48,939
Drive!

435
00:34:49,025 --> 00:34:50,300
Jeez, are you okay?

436
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:52,303
Yeah, I'm fine.

437
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:56,021
- Some spirit here, boys. Move!
- Come on, move!

438
00:34:56,105 --> 00:34:59,018
What the hell is wrong
with you? No one said take a rest!

439
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:02,416
Move your asses to the finish line!
Move! Move!

440
00:35:03,425 --> 00:35:05,303
Hustle! Hustle!

441
00:35:05,385 --> 00:35:07,581
Get your asses across that line!

442
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:11,425
Time! Nice work, Doss!

443
00:35:17,785 --> 00:35:21,062
This is a personal gift
from the United States government

444
00:35:21,145 --> 00:35:22,818
to each and every one of you.

445
00:35:22,905 --> 00:35:27,457
A standard issue U.S. rifle,
caliber.30, M1,

446
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:30,783
a clip-fed, shoulder-fired,
semi-automatic weapon

447
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:34,575
designed to bring death
and destruction to the enemy.

448
00:35:34,665 --> 00:35:39,456
This is to be your lover,
your mistress, your concubine.

449
00:35:39,545 --> 00:35:43,505
Perhaps the only thing in life
you will ever truly love.

450
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:46,464
Fellas, let's dance. Grab a girl.

451
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:49,897
Don't point your gun forward.

452
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:52,096
I do not want to be shot today.

453
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:54,461
No matter how much you are tempted.

454
00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:56,457
Place the weapon by your side.

455
00:35:58,585 --> 00:35:59,905
Pay attention.

456
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,139
Problem, Private Corn Stalk?

457
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:13,060
Is there not one in your size,
or is it the color that is the issue?

458
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:14,625
No, Sarge.

459
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:20,621
I was... I was told
I don't have to carry a weapon.

460
00:36:20,705 --> 00:36:23,618
Come again? Step forward, Private.
I can't be hearing this right.

461
00:36:29,505 --> 00:36:31,064
Well, I'm sorry, Sergeant.

462
00:36:32,905 --> 00:36:34,737
I can't touch a gun.

463
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,059
What exactly is the problem?

464
00:36:39,145 --> 00:36:41,262
No problem, just a mistake, sir.

465
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:43,382
I told the Army when I joined up.

466
00:36:43,465 --> 00:36:45,058
That's not possible.

467
00:36:45,145 --> 00:36:47,341
Do you know why
it's not possible, Private?

468
00:36:47,425 --> 00:36:48,825
No, sir.

469
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:51,545
Because the United States Army
does not make mistakes.

470
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:55,824
So if there's a problem,
you must be that problem.

471
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:58,977
I was just never supposed to be sent
to a rifle company.

472
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:00,784
He's a C.O., sir.

473
00:37:05,705 --> 00:37:09,540
You're a conscientious objector,
and you joined the Army?

474
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:13,904
Well, no, sir,
I'm a conscientious cooperator.

475
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,905
- Are you screwing with me, Doss?
- No. No, sir. I volunteered.

476
00:37:19,985 --> 00:37:22,784
I ain't got no problem
with wearing my uniform,

477
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,902
or saluting the flag and doing my duty.

478
00:37:24,985 --> 00:37:29,059
It's just carrying a gun
and the taking of human life.

479
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:33,895
- You don't kill? That's all.
- Yes, sir, that's all.

480
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,625
You know quite a bit
of killing does occur in a war?

481
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:37,741
Yes, sir.

482
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:39,782
I mean,
that is the essential nature of war.

483
00:37:39,865 --> 00:37:43,097
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

484
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:46,496
Do you have any other requirements
of the United States Army?

485
00:37:46,585 --> 00:37:48,338
Is there anything else
that we can do to ensure

486
00:37:48,425 --> 00:37:50,018
that you have
a comfortable stay here with us?

487
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:52,979
He doesn't want to work on Saturdays, sir.

488
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:56,337
Well, Saturdays...
I'm a Seventh-day Adventist.

489
00:37:56,425 --> 00:38:01,420
So, Saturday is my Sabbath,
so I'm not allowed to work then.

490
00:38:01,505 --> 00:38:03,940
I don't think that poses a problem,
do you, Sergeant?

491
00:38:04,025 --> 00:38:06,620
We shall simply ask the enemy
not to invade on the Sabbath,

492
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:08,464
'cause Private Doss here is at prayer.

493
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:12,265
All right. Now we got that clear.

494
00:38:13,745 --> 00:38:15,657
Now let me tell you my requirements.

495
00:38:15,745 --> 00:38:19,944
They're not as complicated as yours.
They're very simple.

496
00:38:20,025 --> 00:38:22,984
As long as you're in this company,
under my command,

497
00:38:23,065 --> 00:38:25,102
you will obey my orders. Period.

498
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:30,775
If you can't do it here,
I can't trust you to do it in battle.

499
00:38:34,465 --> 00:38:40,143
I'm putting you in for
a Section 8, psychiatric discharge.

500
00:38:40,225 --> 00:38:41,375
Dismissed.

501
00:38:42,265 --> 00:38:44,177
Gentlemen!

502
00:38:44,265 --> 00:38:47,019
I want you to meet Private Desmond Doss.

503
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:51,258
Apparently, Private Doss
does not believe in violence.

504
00:38:51,345 --> 00:38:53,223
He does not practice violence.

505
00:38:53,305 --> 00:38:56,537
He will not even deign to touch a weapon.

506
00:38:56,625 --> 00:39:01,177
You see, Private Doss
is a conscientious objector.

507
00:39:01,265 --> 00:39:07,182
So I plead with you, do not look to him
to save you on the battlefield,

508
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:12,699
because he will undoubtedly be too busy
wrestling with his conscience to assist.

509
00:39:12,785 --> 00:39:16,176
- Sarge, that's not true.
- Private, as you were.

510
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:22,901
Now, I realize some of you
might have strong feelings about this.

511
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,216
It is what we men fight for.

512
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:30,175
To defend our rights,
and to protect our women and children.

513
00:39:30,265 --> 00:39:36,262
Even if Private Doss' beliefs
might cause women and children to die.

514
00:39:36,345 --> 00:39:38,860
So I will expect everyone in this company

515
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:43,224
to give Private Doss
the full measure of respect he is due

516
00:39:43,305 --> 00:39:46,264
for the short time he will be with us.

517
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:47,899
Am I clear?

518
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,465
Yes, Sergeant.

519
00:39:58,825 --> 00:40:00,225
What'cha got there, Dessie?

520
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:05,380
You know what that is.

521
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:07,582
It just seems kind of small.

522
00:40:07,665 --> 00:40:09,304
It's half the Bible for half the man.

523
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:10,978
For Pete's sake, Smitty,
give him back his Bible.

524
00:40:11,065 --> 00:40:12,704
I don't remember speaking to you.

525
00:40:16,865 --> 00:40:20,222
So, how come you don't fight?
You think you're better than us?

526
00:40:20,945 --> 00:40:21,981
No.

527
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:24,260
What if you was attacked?

528
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:27,459
Whoa!

529
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:30,495
Say, like that.

530
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:33,339
The Bible says to turn
the other cheek, don't it?

531
00:40:34,985 --> 00:40:38,103
See, I don't think this is a question
of religion, fellas.

532
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,940
I think this is cowardice,
plain and simple.

533
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:46,059
Is that right, Doss?
Are you chickenshit, that it?

534
00:40:48,185 --> 00:40:51,178
Go on, take a poke.

535
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:54,299
Tell you what, I'm going to
give you a free shot.

536
00:40:55,225 --> 00:40:56,261
Right there.

537
00:40:57,825 --> 00:41:00,465
Hit me, Doss. Go on.

538
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:01,939
- Let him have it.
- Go ahead.

539
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:03,061
No?

540
00:41:06,025 --> 00:41:07,618
Chickenshit.

541
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:10,021
Oh.

542
00:41:10,665 --> 00:41:13,180
Hold on here. What is this?

543
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:14,625
Give me that.

544
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,537
- This is a fine-looking broad.
- Nice.

545
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,184
Hey, pass it around.

546
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:22,305
Now, this would be the kind of
broad that deserves a real man.

547
00:41:23,665 --> 00:41:24,701
Give me that back.

548
00:41:25,945 --> 00:41:26,935
Please.

549
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:30,538
Please.

550
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:33,015
"Please give it back, Smitty."

551
00:41:33,105 --> 00:41:35,062
Please give it back, Smitty.

552
00:41:45,705 --> 00:41:47,822
Do you hear voices, Desmond?

553
00:41:50,785 --> 00:41:52,504
No, sir.

554
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:56,215
But I understand that God
talks to you. Is that right?

555
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,024
Sir, I'm not a crazy person.

556
00:41:58,105 --> 00:42:02,816
Is that how you feel most people
regard you, a crazy person?

557
00:42:02,905 --> 00:42:05,704
I'm different. I know that, but...

558
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,776
I'm not going to pretend
to be something I'm not.

559
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:12,818
- I am what I am.
- Sounds lonely.

560
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:14,934
You lonely?

561
00:42:19,705 --> 00:42:22,459
- So, you don't hear voices.
- No, sir.

562
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:28,821
I pray to God and I like to think He
hears me, but it ain't a conversation,

563
00:42:28,905 --> 00:42:31,739
like the one we're pretending
to have right now.

564
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:33,657
- Pretending, Private?
- Well, yes, sir.

565
00:42:33,745 --> 00:42:36,897
I know all you really want to do is give
me a Section 8, drum me out of the Army,

566
00:42:36,985 --> 00:42:42,458
but I'm not off up above.
I just simply believe what I believe.

567
00:42:42,545 --> 00:42:46,505
Well, I'm trying to understand, all right?

568
00:42:46,585 --> 00:42:50,545
Was it God who told you
not to pick up a rifle?

569
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:53,743
God says not to kill.

570
00:42:53,865 --> 00:42:55,618
That's one of His
most important Commandments.

571
00:42:55,705 --> 00:42:59,255
Most people take that to mean,
"Don't commit murder."

572
00:42:59,345 --> 00:43:02,702
War is a completely different
set of circumstances.

573
00:43:02,785 --> 00:43:07,257
Jesus said,
"A new Commandment I give unto you,

574
00:43:07,345 --> 00:43:10,338
that you love one another,
just as I have loved you."

575
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:12,582
This is Satan himself we're fighting.

576
00:43:12,665 --> 00:43:15,942
Surely, as a good Christian,
you can see that.

577
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:19,416
I can see that, sir,
and that is why I joined up.

578
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,619
But I'm sorry, I will not bear arms.

579
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:27,379
His religious views are certainly unique,

580
00:43:27,465 --> 00:43:30,981
but they do not constitute grounds
for a Section 8 discharge.

581
00:43:31,065 --> 00:43:34,103
How am I supposed to maintain discipline
with a man like that in my unit?

582
00:43:34,185 --> 00:43:35,665
I don't know.

583
00:43:35,745 --> 00:43:38,021
But he is a legitimate
conscientious objector,

584
00:43:38,105 --> 00:43:40,461
and he must be allowed
to work as a combat medic,

585
00:43:40,545 --> 00:43:44,095
provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training.

586
00:43:44,185 --> 00:43:48,862
Perhaps we could help
make believe in his idea.

587
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:51,619
Yeah, you restrict him to barracks and KP.

588
00:43:51,705 --> 00:43:54,061
If he throws God at you,
you throw hell right at him.

589
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:55,420
I want him gone.

590
00:44:12,505 --> 00:44:15,976
Doss, your area is a disgrace.
It's a pig sty!

591
00:44:17,225 --> 00:44:18,898
- Something funny, Ryker?
- No, Sarge!

592
00:44:18,985 --> 00:44:22,535
- You got some shit on your mind?
- No, Sarge!

593
00:44:23,105 --> 00:44:25,176
What you men fail to recognize

594
00:44:25,265 --> 00:44:30,021
is a unit is no better
than its weakest member!

595
00:44:30,105 --> 00:44:34,418
Now, to help you learn that lesson,
there will be no passes this weekend.

596
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,940
You will all be on KP!

597
00:44:37,025 --> 00:44:40,416
Right now, everybody in full gear
for a 20-mile hike.

598
00:44:40,505 --> 00:44:43,145
Let's go! Let's go.

599
00:44:47,065 --> 00:44:49,022
Get your heads right.

600
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,341
Don't start feeling sorry for yourself.

601
00:44:51,425 --> 00:44:54,497
Makes me sick
see you feel sorry for yourself.

602
00:44:54,585 --> 00:44:56,895
You dogs don't know what tired is.

603
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,181
We're going to keep going till I drop.

604
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:11,057
Hey, knock it off. Trying to sleep here.

605
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:17,455
- Get off me. Get off me.
- Okay. All right.

606
00:45:24,465 --> 00:45:26,058
Why the hell are you still here?

607
00:45:37,545 --> 00:45:38,899
As you were.

608
00:45:46,385 --> 00:45:47,501
Where's Doss?

609
00:46:11,025 --> 00:46:12,584
This isn't good for anybody.

610
00:46:12,665 --> 00:46:14,657
Sure ain't what I joined up for.

611
00:46:17,385 --> 00:46:20,139
It's not about what you joined up for.

612
00:46:20,225 --> 00:46:22,740
It's about the lives of every man in here.

613
00:46:24,225 --> 00:46:28,299
And yours, son. It's time to quit this.

614
00:46:29,465 --> 00:46:32,424
Finish getting dressed
and I'll walk you down.

615
00:46:38,705 --> 00:46:40,424
It's okay, Doss.

616
00:46:42,025 --> 00:46:43,539
There's no shame in this.

617
00:46:59,145 --> 00:47:00,943
Let's go.

618
00:47:01,465 --> 00:47:06,256
I got extra guard duty today,
and I'm on KP this morning, so...

619
00:47:09,265 --> 00:47:10,255
Can't.

620
00:47:16,705 --> 00:47:18,344
All right, Doss.

621
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:24,504
Private Doss, can you identify
the men that beat you?

622
00:47:31,425 --> 00:47:33,257
No, Sarge.

623
00:47:33,345 --> 00:47:36,497
Are you saying that you
don't know who attacked you?

624
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:38,497
I never said I was attacked, Sarge.

625
00:47:40,105 --> 00:47:43,098
Well, what the hell are you saying, Doss?

626
00:47:43,185 --> 00:47:45,336
You bruised half your body sleeping?

627
00:47:47,345 --> 00:47:49,337
I... I sleep pretty hard.

628
00:47:50,985 --> 00:47:53,898
Alright.

629
00:47:55,225 --> 00:47:57,501
If you plan on getting wet this weekend,
make sure you put on a hat.

630
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,025
Next.

631
00:47:59,105 --> 00:48:01,222
Don't want anyone
coming back pissing cream.

632
00:48:01,305 --> 00:48:03,581
What, you don't want none
for your coffee, Sarge?

633
00:48:03,665 --> 00:48:06,225
How about a shot right now, Smitty?

634
00:48:06,345 --> 00:48:08,223
- You speaking from experience, Sarge?
- Next.

635
00:48:08,345 --> 00:48:10,382
You'd have to ask
your mom about that, Greaseball.

636
00:48:16,225 --> 00:48:17,261
At ease.

637
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,820
Private Doss, I'm afraid
I can't authorize your pass.

638
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:29,382
This is a furlough for men
who have passed the basic training.

639
00:48:32,385 --> 00:48:34,661
Well, sir, respectfully, sir, I have.

640
00:48:36,265 --> 00:48:38,575
I put in for this furlough
three weeks ago.

641
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,861
I'm getting married this afternoon.

642
00:48:40,945 --> 00:48:43,824
It says you're not rifle qualified.

643
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:47,825
Well, I'm not required to carry
a rifle, sir. Colonel Stelzer, he...

644
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:51,137
Colonel Stelzer's determination was...

645
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:54,099
"Doss must be allowed to
work as a combat medic,

646
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:58,504
provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his training."

647
00:48:58,585 --> 00:49:01,384
And you have not qualified
on the rifle range, Private.

648
00:49:02,385 --> 00:49:03,421
Pretty clear.

649
00:49:06,585 --> 00:49:11,614
Show me you know how to handle a rifle
and I'll sign your furlough.

650
00:49:11,705 --> 00:49:13,617
- Corporal Cannon.
- Sir!

651
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:15,862
Hand Private Doss your firearm.

652
00:49:25,305 --> 00:49:29,504
- I won't touch a rifle, sir.
- I'm not asking you, Private!

653
00:49:29,585 --> 00:49:33,261
That is a direct order
from a company commander.

654
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:39,581
For God's sake, Doss,
you stop this nonsense and quit.

655
00:49:39,665 --> 00:49:44,615
Refuse, and I will have no
recourse but to court-martial you,

656
00:49:44,705 --> 00:49:48,096
and you will spend the duration
of the war in a military prison.

657
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:52,502
I can't, sir.

658
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,384
How much longer would you
like to wait, Dorothy?

659
00:50:08,785 --> 00:50:11,175
I think it's been long enough.

660
00:50:12,385 --> 00:50:14,297
I'm so very sorry.

661
00:50:14,385 --> 00:50:16,695
Sometimes men just get cold feet.

662
00:50:18,825 --> 00:50:22,899
Some men might. Not my Desmond.

663
00:50:55,665 --> 00:50:58,544
You probably think
I'm a real son of a bitch

664
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:01,379
who cares only about regulations
and not his men.

665
00:51:04,505 --> 00:51:05,495
May I?

666
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:15,459
I believe in this book as much as any man.

667
00:51:15,545 --> 00:51:18,265
And just like any man,
I wrestle with my conscience,

668
00:51:18,345 --> 00:51:22,055
but what do you do when everything
you value in this world is under attack?

669
00:51:23,345 --> 00:51:24,904
I don't know, sir.

670
00:51:26,345 --> 00:51:29,543
I ain't got answers to questions that big,

671
00:51:29,625 --> 00:51:33,301
but I also feel like
my values are under attack,

672
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:34,939
and I don't know why.

673
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:39,019
I don't give a rat's ass about your
principles because the Japs don't.

674
00:51:39,105 --> 00:51:41,336
If one of them attacks you
and some wounded soldier,

675
00:51:41,425 --> 00:51:42,415
what are you gonna do?

676
00:51:43,425 --> 00:51:45,462
Hit him with your Bible?

677
00:51:45,545 --> 00:51:47,776
I'm prepared to give my life for my men.

678
00:51:47,865 --> 00:51:51,415
You don't win wars by giving up your life.

679
00:51:51,505 --> 00:51:56,341
Look, I'm only here because I don't want
to see you rotting in a prison cell.

680
00:51:56,425 --> 00:51:58,985
Plead guilty, throw yourself
at the mercy of the court.

681
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:00,784
Maybe they'll let you go home and pray.

682
00:52:03,785 --> 00:52:06,425
Let the brave men out there
go and win this war.

683
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:17,945
If I can't convince you, maybe she can.

684
00:52:19,985 --> 00:52:21,419
They wouldn't let me call you.

685
00:52:23,785 --> 00:52:25,344
I knew it wasn't your making.

686
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:31,136
What have they done to you?

687
00:52:33,425 --> 00:52:34,984
It's okay, I'm all right.

688
00:52:35,065 --> 00:52:38,297
I just went a couple of
rounds with the wall and lost.

689
00:52:38,385 --> 00:52:41,583
They're saying you could
go to prison, Desmond.

690
00:52:41,665 --> 00:52:43,702
Leavenworth.

691
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,697
There must be some other way.

692
00:52:45,785 --> 00:52:47,617
I don't know what that could be.

693
00:52:47,705 --> 00:52:49,822
I've done everything they asked me,
except this one thing,

694
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:52,500
and I'm being treated like
a criminal just 'cause I won't kill.

695
00:52:52,585 --> 00:52:56,898
You tried. Nobody can say you didn't.

696
00:52:56,985 --> 00:52:58,624
But who are you going to save in prison?

697
00:53:01,025 --> 00:53:02,141
Probably nobody.

698
00:53:02,265 --> 00:53:05,019
Then why can't you just pick up
the stupid gun and wave it around?

699
00:53:05,105 --> 00:53:07,825
You don't have to use it,
just meet them halfway.

700
00:53:09,785 --> 00:53:12,095
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can. It's just pride.

701
00:53:12,185 --> 00:53:15,144
Pride and stubbornness.
Don't confuse your will with the Lord's.

702
00:53:28,465 --> 00:53:30,104
Have I been prideful?

703
00:53:31,985 --> 00:53:33,704
Maybe I am prideful.

704
00:53:37,985 --> 00:53:39,738
But I don't know how
I'm going to live with myself

705
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:42,101
if I don't stay true to what I believe.

706
00:53:43,545 --> 00:53:45,616
Much less how you could live with me.

707
00:53:47,785 --> 00:53:51,142
I'd never be the man
that I want to be in your eyes.

708
00:53:57,825 --> 00:54:02,183
I fell in love with you
because you weren't like anyone else

709
00:54:04,185 --> 00:54:06,177
and you didn't try to be.

710
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:13,222
Do not think for one moment
that you will disappoint me.

711
00:54:15,825 --> 00:54:19,580
I will love you no matter what.

712
00:54:31,985 --> 00:54:36,264
I don't know what he's gonna do.
He loses no matter what.

713
00:54:36,905 --> 00:54:38,134
<i>They want him to plead guilty,</i>

714
00:54:38,225 --> 00:54:40,376
<i>but then he'll get
a dishonorable discharge.</i>

715
00:54:40,465 --> 00:54:44,061
Otherwise he fights them,
and he for sure goes to prison.

716
00:54:44,145 --> 00:54:46,057
<i>Either way, they'll call him a coward</i>

717
00:54:46,145 --> 00:54:47,784
<i>and I don't see how he can live with that.</i>

718
00:54:49,105 --> 00:54:50,937
Well, thank you, Dorothy.

719
00:54:52,305 --> 00:54:54,774
If you get to talk to him,

720
00:54:54,865 --> 00:54:57,061
tell him that we love him
and that we're praying for him.

721
00:54:57,145 --> 00:54:59,296
<i>We're praying for both of you.</i>

722
00:54:59,385 --> 00:55:01,422
I will. Bye-bye.

723
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:16,543
<i>Tom, you're out of your mind,
you're delirious.</i>

724
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:18,139
<i>Of course, I'm out of my mind.</i>

725
00:55:18,225 --> 00:55:21,024
<i>What do you think I am?
I'm out of my mind.</i>

726
00:55:21,105 --> 00:55:22,983
<i>You leave this room.</i>

727
00:55:23,065 --> 00:55:24,624
No, Tom! Put it down!

728
00:55:24,705 --> 00:55:26,458
- Get away from me, woman!
- Hey!

729
00:55:44,265 --> 00:55:45,824
I got that, sir.

730
00:55:57,185 --> 00:55:58,619
May I help you, sir?

731
00:55:58,705 --> 00:56:01,265
I wish to speak to
Brigadier General Musgrove.

732
00:56:01,345 --> 00:56:04,179
Not without an appointment you can't.
That would be quite impossible.

733
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,782
Uh, if you would kindly tell him

734
00:56:12,865 --> 00:56:16,654
Corporal Thomas Doss
would appreciate a brief word.

735
00:56:16,745 --> 00:56:19,738
He's in a very important meeting.

736
00:56:19,825 --> 00:56:23,865
I fought with him in France
at Belleau Wood. He was my captain.

737
00:56:26,505 --> 00:56:29,737
Please, ma'am, it's most vital.

738
00:56:33,345 --> 00:56:34,381
Thank you, ma'am.

739
00:56:39,585 --> 00:56:41,338
There's a man out there, Tom Doss.

740
00:56:42,345 --> 00:56:43,415
Doss?

741
00:56:47,785 --> 00:56:48,901
Be over in a minute.

742
00:56:48,985 --> 00:56:52,501
You'll be home safe and sound,
like nothing ever happened.

743
00:56:57,825 --> 00:56:59,054
I love you.

744
00:57:45,865 --> 00:57:48,016
This is a hearing into the matter
of Private Desmond Doss.

745
00:57:48,105 --> 00:57:50,665
The charge is disobeying
a series of direct orders

746
00:57:50,745 --> 00:57:51,940
from his commanding officer.

747
00:57:52,025 --> 00:57:54,335
How says the defendant?

748
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:58,216
Private Doss wishes to enter
a "not guilty" plea.

749
00:57:59,945 --> 00:58:01,982
Is that so, Private?
I thought this was agreed.

750
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:04,540
You wanted to enter
some sort of plea bargain.

751
00:58:06,345 --> 00:58:08,814
- Yes, sir, but I changed my mind.
- Just like that?

752
00:58:08,945 --> 00:58:11,585
You wish to proceed to a court-martial?

753
00:58:12,385 --> 00:58:13,865
- Yes, sir.
- Ah.

754
00:58:13,945 --> 00:58:18,098
Well, on your head, then, Private.
Proceed.

755
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:25,664
Your Honor, Private Doss
waves his morality at us

756
00:58:25,745 --> 00:58:27,862
like it's some kind of badge of honor.

757
00:58:27,945 --> 00:58:31,621
He flaunts his contempt by directly
disobeying a series of direct orders

758
00:58:31,705 --> 00:58:32,934
from his commanding officer.

759
00:58:33,025 --> 00:58:35,665
When the very best of our young men
are sacrificing their lives against...

760
00:58:39,585 --> 00:58:41,816
- You okay?
- Yes.

761
00:58:41,905 --> 00:58:43,544
Are they still deliberating?

762
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:44,820
Yes, sir.

763
00:58:44,905 --> 00:58:46,658
Okay, now you go take this in there.

764
00:58:46,745 --> 00:58:49,544
I can't. It's strictly military personnel.

765
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:51,025
Well, then you get
one of them to take it in.

766
00:58:51,105 --> 00:58:53,381
They ain't out to help.
They're fixing to bury him.

767
00:58:53,465 --> 00:58:57,903
There is only one question that any
military court need ask of the accused.

768
00:58:57,985 --> 00:59:01,695
Do you deny disobeying
Colonel Sangston's direct orders?

769
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,742
Well, do you, Private?

770
00:59:12,065 --> 00:59:15,183
- No, sir. I don't.
- Why are you contesting it, then?

771
00:59:15,305 --> 00:59:18,537
Why is it so important to you, given
your refusal to even touch a weapon,

772
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:20,821
to serve in a combat unit?

773
00:59:20,905 --> 00:59:25,741
Because when the Japanese attacked
Pearl Harbor, I took it personal.

774
00:59:26,465 --> 00:59:29,776
Everyone I knew
was on fire to join up, including me.

775
00:59:33,065 --> 00:59:38,140
There were two men in my home town...
declared 4-F unfit.

776
00:59:38,225 --> 00:59:40,740
They killed themselves
because they couldn't serve.

777
00:59:44,785 --> 00:59:47,823
I had a job in a defense plant
and I could've taken a deferment,

778
00:59:47,905 --> 00:59:49,225
but that ain't right.

779
00:59:51,705 --> 00:59:54,777
It isn't right that other men
should fight and die,

780
00:59:56,145 --> 00:59:58,455
that I would just be sitting at home safe.

781
00:59:58,545 --> 01:00:00,025
I need to serve.

782
01:00:01,705 --> 01:00:04,664
I got the energy
and the passion to serve as a medic.

783
01:00:06,665 --> 01:00:10,215
Right in the middle with the other guys.
No less danger, just...

784
01:00:11,385 --> 01:00:14,457
While everybody else is taking life,
I'm going to be saving it.

785
01:00:17,985 --> 01:00:20,181
With the world so set
on tearing itself apart,

786
01:00:20,265 --> 01:00:22,257
it doesn't seem like
such a bad thing to me

787
01:00:22,345 --> 01:00:24,814
to want to put a little bit
of it back together.

788
01:00:26,825 --> 01:00:29,818
- Hmm.
- Sorry, sir, nobody's allowed to go...

789
01:00:29,905 --> 01:00:31,976
No, you don't understand.
My son is the defendant.

790
01:00:32,065 --> 01:00:33,579
I understand, sir, but nobody's allowed...

791
01:00:33,665 --> 01:00:35,975
- I have information that's important.
- Sir, you are not allowed...

792
01:00:36,065 --> 01:00:37,977
While the sentiments
expressed are laudable,

793
01:00:38,065 --> 01:00:40,864
the facts of the charge
seem incontestable, so...

794
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,262
What the hell is going on out there?

795
01:00:45,185 --> 01:00:46,665
Let him go.

796
01:00:57,305 --> 01:01:00,855
- That's a Great War uniform.
- It is, sir.

797
01:01:00,945 --> 01:01:02,857
Sir, I need to show you this.

798
01:01:02,945 --> 01:01:06,063
With respect, sir, you are no longer
a member of the military.

799
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:09,024
You are unable to attend this hearing.
I'm sorry.

800
01:01:09,105 --> 01:01:12,143
Is that truly the way it works, sir?

801
01:01:12,225 --> 01:01:15,502
You fight for your country,
you lose so much that was dear to you,

802
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:17,497
and then you're done with?

803
01:01:17,585 --> 01:01:19,895
The uniform is forgotten.
You have no voice.

804
01:01:20,665 --> 01:01:21,894
You were at Lys?

805
01:01:21,985 --> 01:01:24,136
I was, sir. And at Belleau Wood.

806
01:01:24,265 --> 01:01:25,745
Twice decorated, I see.

807
01:01:25,825 --> 01:01:27,703
Yes, sir.

808
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:30,220
I take it you are the Private's father.

809
01:01:30,305 --> 01:01:32,183
I am, sir. Thomas Doss.

810
01:01:32,265 --> 01:01:35,975
Then, as a former military man,
you know there are laws here...

811
01:01:36,065 --> 01:01:38,705
Sir, I know the law and I know
my son is protected by those laws.

812
01:01:38,785 --> 01:01:41,061
They are framed in our constitution.

813
01:01:41,145 --> 01:01:43,137
And I believe in them, as he does.

814
01:01:43,225 --> 01:01:46,502
They are why I went
and fought to protect them.

815
01:01:46,585 --> 01:01:48,736
At least, that is what
I thought I was doing.

816
01:01:48,825 --> 01:01:50,259
Because if it wasn't for that,

817
01:01:50,345 --> 01:01:52,814
then I have no idea what the hell
I was doing there, sir.

818
01:01:55,105 --> 01:01:56,937
Thank you, Corporal Doss.

819
01:01:59,145 --> 01:02:00,545
Let me have the letter.

820
01:02:08,345 --> 01:02:09,495
You must go.

821
01:02:25,345 --> 01:02:27,940
"The defendant's rights
as a conscientious objector

822
01:02:28,025 --> 01:02:30,062
are protected by an Act of Congress

823
01:02:30,145 --> 01:02:33,980
and he cannot be compelled
to waive those rights.

824
01:02:34,065 --> 01:02:38,582
That includes, in this case,
his disobeying orders to bear arms."

825
01:02:38,665 --> 01:02:43,057
Signed, Brigadier General Musgrove,
War Services Commander, Washington, D.C.

826
01:02:43,145 --> 01:02:44,465
Colonel?

827
01:02:48,705 --> 01:02:53,143
- I withdraw the charges, sir.
- Then this case is dismissed.

828
01:02:53,225 --> 01:02:56,536
Private Doss, you are free
to run into the hellfire of battle

829
01:02:56,625 --> 01:02:59,584
without a single weapon
to protect yourself.

830
01:03:00,345 --> 01:03:04,259
You may resume your duties
and begin training as a combat medic.

831
01:03:10,785 --> 01:03:12,936
- Where is he?
- Gone. Straight after.

832
01:03:13,025 --> 01:03:14,857
I begged him to stay.
I told him you'd want to see him.

833
01:03:14,945 --> 01:03:17,062
No, I understand.

834
01:03:17,145 --> 01:03:19,057
When you get home,
you tell him I love him.

835
01:03:19,145 --> 01:03:20,784
Okay. Okay.

836
01:04:00,425 --> 01:04:03,065
You better come home to me.

837
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:17,222
<i># Uncle Sam is mild</i>

838
01:04:17,305 --> 01:04:18,944
<i># He's peaceful as a child</i>

839
01:04:19,065 --> 01:04:20,818
<i># But never get him
riled or you'll be whipped #</i>

840
01:04:20,905 --> 01:04:22,385
Hollywood, shut up.

841
01:04:22,465 --> 01:04:23,899
Come on, pipe down.

842
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,704
- Shut up, man.
- Shut up!

843
01:04:25,785 --> 01:04:27,856
I swear to God,
Hollywood, I will shoot you.

844
01:04:27,945 --> 01:04:30,062
Put a sock in it, will you?
Save the crowing for when we get there.

845
01:04:30,145 --> 01:04:32,057
Killjoy was here.

846
01:04:34,345 --> 01:04:35,540
Give him room.

847
01:04:35,665 --> 01:04:38,225
Clear! Clear! Move aside!

848
01:05:25,945 --> 01:05:29,336
The 96th... or what's left of them.

849
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,223
These are the guys we're replacing.

850
01:06:02,585 --> 01:06:03,860
- Seems good to me.
- Clear.

851
01:06:03,945 --> 01:06:05,425
- As gold.
- Clear.

852
01:06:06,265 --> 01:06:08,018
All clear, Sarge!

853
01:06:26,105 --> 01:06:27,539
Captain Glover.

854
01:06:28,945 --> 01:06:31,096
Lieutenant Manville, 96th.

855
01:06:31,185 --> 01:06:33,063
We've been assigned to you, sir.

856
01:06:33,145 --> 01:06:34,784
Okay.

857
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:36,902
- Let's get these men some chow.
- Yes, sir.

858
01:06:36,985 --> 01:06:38,339
This is, uh, Sergeant Howell.

859
01:06:38,425 --> 01:06:39,700
- Good to meet you, sir.
- Sit down.

860
01:06:39,785 --> 01:06:40,821
Who's Doss?

861
01:06:42,305 --> 01:06:43,625
Over there.

862
01:06:45,865 --> 01:06:47,140
You Doss?

863
01:06:49,665 --> 01:06:51,065
Irv Schecter.

864
01:06:56,505 --> 01:07:01,739
You, and me and Page here are about the
only medics we got left in this area.

865
01:07:01,825 --> 01:07:04,784
So, I guess we're gonna be
working together.

866
01:07:05,465 --> 01:07:07,263
You just come off the line?

867
01:07:07,345 --> 01:07:08,574
What's it like?

868
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,339
I said, what's it like?

869
01:07:16,105 --> 01:07:17,664
Hacksaw.

870
01:07:18,905 --> 01:07:22,865
We climbed up six times.
Six times, they threw us off.

871
01:07:26,225 --> 01:07:29,059
Last time, there wasn't
anything left of the 96th.

872
01:07:32,185 --> 01:07:33,380
They're animals.

873
01:07:35,505 --> 01:07:37,417
Stinking animals.

874
01:07:37,505 --> 01:07:39,656
Nips don't care if they live or die.

875
01:07:40,945 --> 01:07:43,938
They want to die. They keep coming at you.

876
01:07:44,025 --> 01:07:46,585
And they ain't never going to give up.

877
01:07:47,505 --> 01:07:49,144
Never.

878
01:07:49,225 --> 01:07:51,057
Here. Hey, buddy.

879
01:07:55,665 --> 01:07:58,783
The Japs deliberately target the wounded.

880
01:07:58,865 --> 01:08:01,858
Lose all your Red Cross markings.

881
01:08:01,945 --> 01:08:04,176
Nips put a premium on shooting medics.

882
01:08:05,145 --> 01:08:06,704
The white is a bull's-eye.

883
01:08:08,185 --> 01:08:10,097
Here, I got you a new helmet.

884
01:08:11,225 --> 01:08:12,784
One size fits all.

885
01:08:20,985 --> 01:08:24,023
That's our objective. Hacksaw Ridge.

886
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:27,775
We take it, maybe we get Okinawa.

887
01:08:27,865 --> 01:08:30,858
We get Okinawa, we take Japan.

888
01:08:30,985 --> 01:08:34,695
Take a breather. Our pals in the Navy
are going to soften them up for us.

889
01:09:01,585 --> 01:09:03,702
Nobody can survive that shit.

890
01:09:04,985 --> 01:09:06,783
Oh, but they can.

891
01:09:25,505 --> 01:09:29,624
Lieutenant, these bunkers here,
here and here, is that accurate?

892
01:09:30,825 --> 01:09:33,624
Yeah, there's three...

893
01:09:41,905 --> 01:09:45,262
Yes, sir, maybe a little further back,
but it's all...

894
01:09:46,865 --> 01:09:48,902
It's all different up there.

895
01:09:48,985 --> 01:09:50,738
<i>All clear, Captain.</i>

896
01:09:52,145 --> 01:09:54,899
Gents, move out.

897
01:10:21,025 --> 01:10:22,664
It's blood.

898
01:10:22,745 --> 01:10:23,974
No shit.

899
01:10:25,865 --> 01:10:27,857
We're not in Kansas anymore, Dorothy.

900
01:10:30,185 --> 01:10:31,335
Keep climbing.

901
01:10:42,025 --> 01:10:43,903
Here, come on.

902
01:11:03,985 --> 01:11:06,295
Coming through, make way. Out of the way.

903
01:11:10,985 --> 01:11:12,180
- Brown.
- What?

904
01:11:12,265 --> 01:11:13,335
Give this to Jessop.

905
01:11:13,425 --> 01:11:14,415
Corporal!

906
01:13:00,825 --> 01:13:01,861
Incoming!

907
01:13:04,265 --> 01:13:05,460
Get down!

908
01:13:08,225 --> 01:13:09,261
Get down!

909
01:13:22,465 --> 01:13:25,060
Where the hell are they?
I can't see nothing.

910
01:13:26,345 --> 01:13:28,541
- Beats me, pal.
- Where the...

911
01:13:32,865 --> 01:13:34,345
Medic!

912
01:13:34,425 --> 01:13:36,576
We're over here!

913
01:13:38,825 --> 01:13:41,101
Put your hand right here.
Put your hand on there, Jack.

914
01:13:41,185 --> 01:13:42,983
Come on, come on.

915
01:13:43,065 --> 01:13:45,625
Come on, we're going to get you
under cover. Come on, come with me.

916
01:13:45,705 --> 01:13:47,219
Come with me, Jack.

917
01:14:03,945 --> 01:14:06,824
Keep moving forward! Move!

918
01:14:15,225 --> 01:14:16,500
I can't see anything.

919
01:14:16,585 --> 01:14:18,338
- Is that one?
- I don't know. Just shoot!

920
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:26,379
All right, let's go.

921
01:14:30,145 --> 01:14:31,215
Vito!

922
01:14:35,985 --> 01:14:37,339
Oh, shit.

923
01:14:45,545 --> 01:14:48,014
- Medic! Vito's down!
- I'm coming!

924
01:14:48,105 --> 01:14:50,176
Okay. I'm here.

925
01:15:03,345 --> 01:15:04,461
Get out of the way!

926
01:15:35,945 --> 01:15:36,935
You hurt?

927
01:15:37,665 --> 01:15:39,338
I'm fine.

928
01:15:57,065 --> 01:15:59,580
Come on, I got you, Ralph. Just breathe.

929
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:07,658
Just breathe. Just breathe, Ralph.
It's okay. It's okay.

930
01:16:08,745 --> 01:16:10,816
Just breathe, Ralph, just breathe.

931
01:16:11,985 --> 01:16:14,500
I got you, I got you. I got you. Come on.

932
01:16:17,025 --> 01:16:20,302
Hey! Hey! Give him a shot
of morphine and move on.

933
01:16:21,545 --> 01:16:22,945
He's not going to last a day.

934
01:16:23,025 --> 01:16:26,382
Please. Please, Doss, no.
No. Don't leave me.

935
01:16:26,465 --> 01:16:28,934
Don't leave me.
God, please don't leave me.

936
01:16:29,025 --> 01:16:30,937
I've got kids!

937
01:16:31,025 --> 01:16:34,063
Please. Please, don't.
Please, don't leave me.

938
01:16:34,145 --> 01:16:37,138
I ain't going anywhere.
I'm going to get you home.

939
01:16:37,225 --> 01:16:40,457
I got you, Ralph. Okay?
I'm going to get you home.

940
01:16:42,145 --> 01:16:44,262
Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.

941
01:16:44,345 --> 01:16:45,904
It's going to kick in real quick, Ralph.

942
01:16:45,985 --> 01:16:47,977
We're going to get you shifted.

943
01:16:48,105 --> 01:16:51,576
Stretcher! Stretcher!

944
01:16:56,985 --> 01:16:59,056
- Get up. Keep moving, son.
- I can't, I'm wounded.

945
01:16:59,145 --> 01:17:00,340
There's nothing wrong with you.

946
01:17:02,385 --> 01:17:03,785
Shit! Hang on, kid.

947
01:17:07,025 --> 01:17:09,494
Move. A sitting duck's a dead one.

948
01:17:10,265 --> 01:17:12,302
Move. Go, go, go!

949
01:17:12,385 --> 01:17:14,058
This guy's a priority.

950
01:17:15,305 --> 01:17:18,104
We got him, we got him. Here.

951
01:17:20,065 --> 01:17:23,263
A priority? You ever heard of triage?
He'll be dead before we get him down.

952
01:17:23,345 --> 01:17:24,495
You don't know that!

953
01:17:25,745 --> 01:17:29,500
Get him down. All right? Huh?

954
01:17:29,585 --> 01:17:32,384
- Okay. Okay. Go.
- Okay. Okay.

955
01:17:33,425 --> 01:17:35,382
It's all right, buddy.
We're going to get you home.

956
01:17:40,465 --> 01:17:44,015
Medic! Help! Help.

957
01:17:44,105 --> 01:17:47,303
I figure if we can't see them,
then they can't see us neither.

958
01:17:48,825 --> 01:17:49,815
Help!

959
01:18:01,585 --> 01:18:03,338
I got you, Frank. Where you hit?

960
01:18:14,305 --> 01:18:17,457
- I think they can see us, smart ass!
- Doss, come on, come on.

961
01:18:17,545 --> 01:18:18,740
Give me a hand here.

962
01:18:22,425 --> 01:18:24,098
Get down, sir.

963
01:18:24,185 --> 01:18:26,336
Over there! The bunkers.

964
01:18:28,585 --> 01:18:31,145
I see them. Better stay down, sir.

965
01:18:34,185 --> 01:18:37,701
- I got 'em, dead ahead.
- Yeah, I see 'em, too.

966
01:18:37,785 --> 01:18:39,981
Push in as close as you can.
Give them everything you've got.

967
01:18:40,065 --> 01:18:42,102
I'll send in the
weapons team to flank them.

968
01:18:49,105 --> 01:18:52,337
You keep that tight, you're going to be
right as rain. All right?

969
01:18:52,425 --> 01:18:54,178
I got him, Doss. I got him.

970
01:18:54,265 --> 01:18:56,336
Here you go, come on now.
Come sit over here.

971
01:18:56,425 --> 01:18:57,461
Hey.

972
01:18:58,265 --> 01:18:59,494
You doing okay?

973
01:18:59,585 --> 01:19:00,655
Okay.

974
01:19:12,785 --> 01:19:14,299
And, fire!

975
01:19:27,065 --> 01:19:28,055
Down!

976
01:19:32,265 --> 01:19:33,904
Son of a bitch.

977
01:19:35,225 --> 01:19:37,057
- You, get on it.
- Yes, sir!

978
01:19:38,225 --> 01:19:41,263
Take 'em. Go. Fire!

979
01:19:47,945 --> 01:19:49,265
Cover!

980
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:59,938
Go, go. Go, Ghoul.
Get in the hole. Stay there.

981
01:20:03,505 --> 01:20:07,294
Go! Go, Smitty, we'll cover you. Leapfrog.

982
01:20:13,345 --> 01:20:14,574
Cover.

983
01:20:21,305 --> 01:20:22,978
Satchel!

984
01:20:26,305 --> 01:20:28,137
- Ghoul!
- Clear.

985
01:20:32,745 --> 01:20:36,455
Come on, stick it. Stick it, Ghoul.

986
01:20:38,665 --> 01:20:40,543
Cover! Cover!

987
01:20:52,465 --> 01:20:54,058
Son of a bitch.

988
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:06,544
Cover his ass.

989
01:21:08,825 --> 01:21:11,545
Medic! Medic! Help me.

990
01:21:38,945 --> 01:21:39,935
Go!

991
01:22:25,505 --> 01:22:26,734
Medic!

992
01:22:29,385 --> 01:22:32,742
I'm here. Put your hand on it.
Put your hand on it!

993
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:04,741
Go, go, go!

994
01:23:19,985 --> 01:23:22,136
Ghoul. Ghoul.

995
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:25,543
You're okay. Where you hit?

996
01:23:29,105 --> 01:23:31,097
You got a bump on the head, that's okay.

997
01:23:31,865 --> 01:23:33,140
What's your name?

998
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:35,700
- Andy.
- Andy what?

999
01:23:36,465 --> 01:23:37,865
Andy Walker.

1000
01:23:37,945 --> 01:23:39,743
Also known as?

1001
01:23:39,825 --> 01:23:42,135
Ghoul.

1002
01:23:42,225 --> 01:23:44,023
Ghoul. Ghoul, you're okay, you're okay.

1003
01:23:49,145 --> 01:23:51,341
Good job, men. Good work.

1004
01:23:51,425 --> 01:23:53,940
Dig in for the night. We hold this spot,

1005
01:23:54,025 --> 01:23:56,585
we mop up the rest of the ridge tomorrow.

1006
01:23:57,345 --> 01:24:01,862
Okay, boys. Find yourself a nice
safe hole in or near the bunker.

1007
01:24:01,945 --> 01:24:03,857
Rotate watch every two hours.

1008
01:24:03,945 --> 01:24:07,017
We don't know what's out there.
Heads down, asses lower.

1009
01:24:07,105 --> 01:24:08,903
And shoot anything
that don't speak English.

1010
01:24:08,985 --> 01:24:11,705
- Does that include Grease, Sarge?
- Particularly him.

1011
01:24:11,785 --> 01:24:14,061
I don't care if you need to
take a piss or a dump,

1012
01:24:14,145 --> 01:24:16,137
it ain't safe to go out there alone.

1013
01:24:16,225 --> 01:24:17,739
Over here, now!

1014
01:24:17,825 --> 01:24:19,339
Where the hell are you going, Doss?

1015
01:24:20,865 --> 01:24:23,016
Still more wounded out there, Sarge.

1016
01:24:23,105 --> 01:24:24,744
I'll go with him.

1017
01:24:24,825 --> 01:24:26,862
Be smart. Keep your ears down.

1018
01:24:28,745 --> 01:24:30,464
All right, let's find a spot.

1019
01:24:37,865 --> 01:24:42,496
Rinnelli and Henry dead in
the first 15 minutes, just straight off.

1020
01:24:43,705 --> 01:24:45,936
Straight off.

1021
01:24:46,025 --> 01:24:50,224
Peterson, Popeye. Standford and Murphy.

1022
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:52,385
Page and Unger.

1023
01:24:54,865 --> 01:24:56,743
Ralston.

1024
01:24:56,825 --> 01:25:03,664
"In peace, sons bury their fathers,
in war, fathers bury their sons."

1025
01:25:05,705 --> 01:25:08,584
You wanna stop spouting that crap, huh?

1026
01:25:09,825 --> 01:25:12,579
It don't help none.

1027
01:25:12,665 --> 01:25:17,182
Yeah, you got that right. Not here.

1028
01:25:19,585 --> 01:25:22,544
Hey, give me that.

1029
01:25:29,585 --> 01:25:32,259
Hey, we've got an abdominal wound.

1030
01:25:32,345 --> 01:25:34,541
This man is going to need some plasma.

1031
01:25:34,625 --> 01:25:35,979
- You got it.
- Leave him with us.

1032
01:25:36,065 --> 01:25:38,182
Okay. You're okay now. They got you.

1033
01:25:47,545 --> 01:25:48,979
Should we find a hole and dig in?

1034
01:25:49,865 --> 01:25:50,935
Sounds good to me.

1035
01:25:52,585 --> 01:25:53,814
Put your helmet on.

1036
01:26:03,785 --> 01:26:05,265
You ain't going to eat them?

1037
01:26:07,945 --> 01:26:10,255
I don't eat meat. Help yourself.

1038
01:26:11,905 --> 01:26:13,055
Of course you don't.

1039
01:26:22,305 --> 01:26:23,580
That's one heck of a dame.

1040
01:26:26,145 --> 01:26:29,138
You know you're fighting out of your
weight class with her, don't you?

1041
01:26:36,265 --> 01:26:37,984
Yes, I do.

1042
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:41,264
Don't tell her that.

1043
01:26:41,345 --> 01:26:43,302
She'd be much happier
with a man like me anyway.

1044
01:26:43,385 --> 01:26:45,342
Yeah, until she got to know you.

1045
01:26:47,145 --> 01:26:49,023
I'm an asshole sometimes.

1046
01:26:49,665 --> 01:26:50,701
Sometimes?

1047
01:26:54,185 --> 01:26:56,097
Yeah, all right. All right.

1048
01:27:22,385 --> 01:27:23,739
These Japs are sneaky.

1049
01:27:25,625 --> 01:27:28,220
I'll take first watch, all right?
You get some shut-eye.

1050
01:28:14,105 --> 01:28:15,255
Hell of a dream.

1051
01:28:33,345 --> 01:28:37,385
Dreamed I got myself skewered.
I couldn't do nothing.

1052
01:28:39,025 --> 01:28:40,175
Rifle's just there.

1053
01:28:45,265 --> 01:28:46,494
It won't bite.

1054
01:28:48,105 --> 01:28:49,380
Yeah, it will.

1055
01:28:51,465 --> 01:28:52,865
Look around you.

1056
01:28:52,945 --> 01:28:55,221
After what we've just been through,

1057
01:28:55,305 --> 01:28:57,342
any sane man would be
screaming for a weapon.

1058
01:28:57,425 --> 01:28:59,337
I never claimed to be sane.

1059
01:29:05,385 --> 01:29:07,058
My daddy's a drunk.

1060
01:29:09,465 --> 01:29:12,424
He fought it for years,
but it kind of got a hold of him hard.

1061
01:29:12,505 --> 01:29:13,655
Made him mean.

1062
01:29:13,745 --> 01:29:15,020
Least you knew him.

1063
01:29:15,105 --> 01:29:18,337
Mine could have been any one of 10 guys,
and none of them worth a damn, so...

1064
01:29:20,225 --> 01:29:21,784
So, your momma raised you?

1065
01:29:21,865 --> 01:29:24,937
I knew her, but she gave me
to an orphanage when I was five.

1066
01:29:25,025 --> 01:29:26,300
Never saw her again.

1067
01:29:28,465 --> 01:29:30,218
I learned how to hate quick.

1068
01:29:31,625 --> 01:29:35,255
I learned how to judge people quicker,
and I got you very wrong.

1069
01:29:44,625 --> 01:29:47,538
My daddy used to beat me and my brother
just because the sun rose,

1070
01:29:47,625 --> 01:29:49,742
and then whip us just because it set.

1071
01:29:52,305 --> 01:29:53,705
I could take that...

1072
01:29:55,945 --> 01:29:58,301
...but when he would do it to our momma...

1073
01:29:58,385 --> 01:30:00,536
Get away from me, woman!

1074
01:30:07,985 --> 01:30:11,183
That's enough. No more. Do you hear me?

1075
01:30:11,265 --> 01:30:13,097
Pull the damn trigger.

1076
01:30:13,185 --> 01:30:17,737
Stop it! Stop!

1077
01:30:22,825 --> 01:30:24,100
But you didn't kill him?

1078
01:30:26,825 --> 01:30:28,703
In my heart, I did.

1079
01:30:50,265 --> 01:30:52,097
So that's why I made my promise to God,

1080
01:30:52,185 --> 01:30:54,256
I ain't never going to touch a gun again.

1081
01:30:59,025 --> 01:31:01,460
Well, I ain't giving you mine,
'cause you're crazy.

1082
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:24,820
Son of a...

1083
01:31:28,465 --> 01:31:29,740
Son of a bitch.

1084
01:32:05,585 --> 01:32:08,703
Move, move! Get your asses over here.

1085
01:32:08,785 --> 01:32:10,105
Let's go!

1086
01:32:28,705 --> 01:32:31,982
Fall back, fall back! Go!

1087
01:32:45,985 --> 01:32:48,102
They're coming from underground.

1088
01:32:49,465 --> 01:32:52,060
Searchlight, this is Baker Six.
Request immediate support.

1089
01:32:52,145 --> 01:32:55,024
Target is Yoke-Tare-Five-One-Five.

1090
01:32:55,105 --> 01:32:57,062
Yes! Yes, I know
that's where the hell we are,

1091
01:32:57,145 --> 01:32:58,659
but I don't expect to be here much longer!

1092
01:33:00,505 --> 01:33:02,098
I called an artillery strike.

1093
01:33:02,185 --> 01:33:04,859
Fall back. Move. Move!

1094
01:33:11,345 --> 01:33:13,496
Fall back! Incoming!

1095
01:33:40,825 --> 01:33:43,181
Hey, buddy. I'm right here. Right here.

1096
01:33:50,985 --> 01:33:51,975
Okay.

1097
01:33:53,065 --> 01:33:54,260
Cover me.

1098
01:33:57,225 --> 01:33:58,295
Go, go!

1099
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:12,737
Get out of here, kid!

1100
01:34:15,545 --> 01:34:16,774
Come here, son.

1101
01:34:20,305 --> 01:34:22,820
You know what to do. Keep pressure on it.

1102
01:34:26,705 --> 01:34:29,095
No! Don't need plasma. Give it to him.

1103
01:34:29,185 --> 01:34:33,384
Over there. I'll be okay. Go. Go.

1104
01:34:33,465 --> 01:34:35,138
- Grease! Get Irv's back.
- What?

1105
01:34:35,225 --> 01:34:37,217
- You got it, okay.
- See you soon.

1106
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:44,859
Come on. Come on.

1107
01:34:48,265 --> 01:34:51,224
We gotta move right now. Come on, come on.

1108
01:35:15,825 --> 01:35:17,498
Go! Go! Go!

1109
01:35:24,705 --> 01:35:25,980
Change!

1110
01:35:31,585 --> 01:35:33,304
There's too many,
get the hell out of here!

1111
01:35:33,385 --> 01:35:35,104
Move! Move!

1112
01:36:19,225 --> 01:36:22,218
- I'm scared. I'm scared.
- It's going to help the pain.

1113
01:36:25,105 --> 01:36:28,337
No, don't. Don't you do that. Come on.

1114
01:36:28,425 --> 01:36:31,065
Come on, Smitty, you stay with me.
Let's go. We gotta move.

1115
01:36:52,665 --> 01:36:53,860
- Hey!
- Yeah.

1116
01:36:53,945 --> 01:36:55,345
Help me get him down.
Help me get him down.

1117
01:36:55,425 --> 01:36:56,905
Yeah.

1118
01:36:56,985 --> 01:36:58,419
Come on, let's move. Come on.

1119
01:36:58,505 --> 01:37:00,462
Can't help him, buddy, he's gone.

1120
01:37:00,545 --> 01:37:02,855
- No.
- Come on! We gotta get outta here!

1121
01:37:02,985 --> 01:37:04,260
Let's go!

1122
01:37:05,905 --> 01:37:07,305
Come on, let's go.

1123
01:37:16,505 --> 01:37:18,178
Come on. Everyone.

1124
01:37:18,265 --> 01:37:19,665
Off the ridge!

1125
01:37:57,785 --> 01:37:59,822
What is it you want of me?

1126
01:38:07,985 --> 01:38:09,499
I don't understand.

1127
01:38:15,905 --> 01:38:17,464
I can't hear you.

1128
01:38:18,945 --> 01:38:21,221
Medic, help me! Help me!

1129
01:38:21,305 --> 01:38:23,024
Help me!

1130
01:38:27,825 --> 01:38:29,498
Help me, Lord.

1131
01:38:29,585 --> 01:38:31,144
All right.

1132
01:38:49,585 --> 01:38:52,623
You're in good hands. Easy does it. Easy.

1133
01:38:52,705 --> 01:38:54,503
...six... eight...

1134
01:38:55,865 --> 01:38:57,345
Fourteen.

1135
01:38:57,425 --> 01:38:58,984
Get these men secured immediately.

1136
01:38:59,065 --> 01:39:00,215
Yes, sir.

1137
01:39:00,305 --> 01:39:04,936
- Private Ford, how many?
- Thirty-two only came down, sir.

1138
01:39:05,065 --> 01:39:06,579
- Good Lord.
- Let's go!

1139
01:39:08,265 --> 01:39:10,382
- Let's load 'em up.
- Yes, sir.

1140
01:39:49,305 --> 01:39:51,774
Harry. It's Desmond.

1141
01:39:51,905 --> 01:39:55,421
We going to fix you up.
You just got to keep breathing. Okay?

1142
01:39:56,785 --> 01:39:59,459
- Colonel wants to see you, sir.
- I need your jeep.

1143
01:39:59,545 --> 01:40:02,060
You two stay here, keep watch,
keep your eyes peeled for Japs.

1144
01:40:02,145 --> 01:40:03,704
- No, but...
- Stay here! Keep watch.

1145
01:40:03,785 --> 01:40:05,060
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1146
01:40:14,065 --> 01:40:16,864
Help. Help me.

1147
01:40:16,945 --> 01:40:20,302
Watch out. I got you.

1148
01:40:24,905 --> 01:40:26,976
Put your hand on it. Keep pressure on it.

1149
01:40:27,105 --> 01:40:29,574
- I'm comin' back. Okay?
- Okay.

1150
01:40:45,505 --> 01:40:47,258
Easy, fellas, easy.

1151
01:40:47,345 --> 01:40:48,620
Here we go.

1152
01:40:52,985 --> 01:40:55,944
Okay, guys, let's go.
On the count of three. One, two, three.

1153
01:40:58,145 --> 01:41:00,376
Help, medic over here!

1154
01:41:02,385 --> 01:41:03,705
It's okay, buddy, hold it together.

1155
01:41:06,425 --> 01:41:08,417
We're at the edge, Eric.

1156
01:41:08,505 --> 01:41:11,304
You just sit tight, okay?

1157
01:41:30,545 --> 01:41:33,265
You're okay, Eric. You're okay, buddy.

1158
01:41:38,145 --> 01:41:40,376
Son of a gun, this is going to work.

1159
01:41:40,465 --> 01:41:42,422
One for each leg, Eric.

1160
01:41:42,505 --> 01:41:45,498
We're going to get you dressed up
in a jiffy and get you down.

1161
01:41:45,585 --> 01:41:47,338
I got you.

1162
01:41:48,945 --> 01:41:50,743
I got you now, Eric.

1163
01:41:50,825 --> 01:41:53,738
You have to trust me now, Eric.
You're gonna have to trust me.

1164
01:42:22,465 --> 01:42:23,660
Japs!

1165
01:42:23,745 --> 01:42:26,897
Hold on, one of ours.
Hold on! Let's go, let's go!

1166
01:42:28,785 --> 01:42:31,983
I got you. I got you. I got you.

1167
01:42:32,105 --> 01:42:35,815
Come on, I got you.
You're okay. You're okay.

1168
01:42:40,305 --> 01:42:42,695
Hank, another one.

1169
01:42:48,145 --> 01:42:50,421
Colonel, call off the artillery
attack on Hacksaw.

1170
01:42:50,505 --> 01:42:53,896
Couldn't call it in. There's still
over 100 men left up there.

1171
01:42:53,985 --> 01:42:56,295
Tell them to call off
the artillery on Hacksaw.

1172
01:42:58,265 --> 01:43:00,734
Sit down, Jack. I'll get you a drink.

1173
01:43:12,265 --> 01:43:13,824
We just lost our cover.

1174
01:43:16,385 --> 01:43:18,661
They're stirrin', we got to move. Come on.

1175
01:43:24,985 --> 01:43:28,535
About time.
They just keep coming by the...

1176
01:43:28,625 --> 01:43:31,265
- OK, OK. Pick it up.
- I got this.

1177
01:44:08,065 --> 01:44:10,899
Doss. Doss.

1178
01:44:12,145 --> 01:44:15,343
Help. Help me.

1179
01:44:26,825 --> 01:44:30,739
You're gonna have to trust me.
Take a breath.

1180
01:45:29,425 --> 01:45:32,338
Let's go, buddy. Let's go.

1181
01:45:34,785 --> 01:45:37,425
Jack, you don't know
if your men up there are dead or alive.

1182
01:45:37,505 --> 01:45:39,781
You can't go back up there
without reinforcements.

1183
01:45:39,865 --> 01:45:40,901
You'll end up killing the rest of them.

1184
01:45:40,985 --> 01:45:41,975
Then give me the reinforcements.

1185
01:45:42,065 --> 01:45:45,820
I don't have any fresh men, okay?
I don't have any troops.

1186
01:45:45,905 --> 01:45:47,976
Three battalions got wiped out today.

1187
01:45:48,065 --> 01:45:50,739
It'll take more than a day
to get men in here.

1188
01:45:50,825 --> 01:45:52,464
I need them faster than that.

1189
01:47:44,305 --> 01:47:47,104
It's okay, it's okay.

1190
01:47:47,185 --> 01:47:48,699
It's all right. It's all right.

1191
01:47:49,505 --> 01:47:50,939
Everything's okay.

1192
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:09,784
Morphine. It's good.

1193
01:48:11,225 --> 01:48:13,296
Shh.

1194
01:48:47,745 --> 01:48:50,544
Pinnick, Pinnick. Pinnick. It's Doss.

1195
01:48:50,625 --> 01:48:54,175
It's Doss. Be quiet. Be quiet. I got you.

1196
01:48:54,265 --> 01:48:57,258
- Are you hit?
- Yeah. I can't see.

1197
01:48:57,345 --> 01:48:59,655
Be quiet. Just be quiet.

1198
01:49:01,225 --> 01:49:07,017
Hold still now. I got you. Hold tight.

1199
01:49:07,105 --> 01:49:09,825
There you go. Try now. Try now.

1200
01:49:12,505 --> 01:49:15,703
I thought I was blind!

1201
01:49:15,785 --> 01:49:18,175
Shh... Keep it down. Can you walk?

1202
01:49:18,305 --> 01:49:19,625
I don't know.

1203
01:49:19,705 --> 01:49:21,583
We got to get out of here, okay? Come on.

1204
01:49:35,225 --> 01:49:37,740
Good. Okay, we got you.

1205
01:49:37,865 --> 01:49:39,094
We got you.

1206
01:49:52,865 --> 01:49:54,618
Hey, Ted.

1207
01:49:54,705 --> 01:49:58,062
It's me, it's Desmond.
I'm gonna fix you up.

1208
01:49:59,865 --> 01:50:02,983
- You ready to get out of here?
- Sure am.

1209
01:50:17,705 --> 01:50:21,824
Please, Lord, help me get one more.

1210
01:50:21,905 --> 01:50:23,578
Help me get one more.

1211
01:50:51,265 --> 01:50:54,144
Please, help me get one more.

1212
01:51:13,345 --> 01:51:16,224
One more. Help me get one more.

1213
01:51:28,505 --> 01:51:32,624
One more. Help me get one more.

1214
01:51:35,745 --> 01:51:37,099
One more.

1215
01:51:38,865 --> 01:51:40,219
Coming through.

1216
01:51:42,985 --> 01:51:44,738
Where the hell are these guys coming from?

1217
01:51:44,865 --> 01:51:46,015
From Hacksaw.

1218
01:51:46,105 --> 01:51:48,825
- I thought they pulled out.
- Not all of them.

1219
01:51:48,905 --> 01:51:51,818
Some nut's up there
dragging wounded from the top.

1220
01:51:51,905 --> 01:51:54,659
Even lowered a couple of Japs.

1221
01:51:54,745 --> 01:51:57,863
They didn't make it.
Back with you directly.

1222
01:51:58,585 --> 01:52:01,657
Easy, easy. All set, move out.

1223
01:52:33,425 --> 01:52:35,382
Get in here. There's Nips everywhere.

1224
01:52:37,025 --> 01:52:40,655
Son of a bitch. Private Corn Stalk.

1225
01:52:40,745 --> 01:52:42,782
You are nothing if not full of surprises.

1226
01:52:42,865 --> 01:52:44,697
You want some morphine?

1227
01:52:44,785 --> 01:52:48,574
- Hell, yes. That or a bullet.
- Okay.

1228
01:52:48,665 --> 01:52:50,896
There. There you go.

1229
01:52:54,625 --> 01:52:57,936
All right, let me see. Let me see.

1230
01:52:58,065 --> 01:53:00,899
How's this doing? Okay, not bad.

1231
01:53:02,705 --> 01:53:04,662
Let me see.

1232
01:53:04,745 --> 01:53:06,259
It looks much worse than it is.

1233
01:53:06,345 --> 01:53:08,098
Girls will still want to kiss you.

1234
01:53:09,785 --> 01:53:12,983
Sarge, you okay here for a while?

1235
01:53:13,065 --> 01:53:15,261
Yeah, fine. Get out of here.

1236
01:53:15,345 --> 01:53:16,984
I'm coming back.

1237
01:53:17,065 --> 01:53:19,182
You ready? Let's go. You and me, come on.

1238
01:53:54,105 --> 01:53:56,540
Captain. There's something you gotta see.

1239
01:53:59,345 --> 01:54:01,621
Our guys have been
coming down in droves all night.

1240
01:54:01,705 --> 01:54:04,061
And Hollywood's here.
I never thought I'd see that guy again.

1241
01:54:04,145 --> 01:54:05,784
Come on, follow me. He's right here.

1242
01:54:09,625 --> 01:54:11,742
What the hell is this?

1243
01:54:11,825 --> 01:54:13,305
How you doing, sir?

1244
01:54:13,385 --> 01:54:14,739
Hey, Cap.

1245
01:54:14,825 --> 01:54:15,975
Captain.

1246
01:54:18,385 --> 01:54:21,344
- It's good to see you, kid.
- Captain Glover, sir.

1247
01:54:21,425 --> 01:54:22,779
How'd you get down, son?

1248
01:54:22,865 --> 01:54:25,858
Doss. Howell's still up there.

1249
01:54:25,985 --> 01:54:28,420
What, Howell and Doss did this?

1250
01:54:28,505 --> 01:54:30,542
Mostly just Doss.

1251
01:54:30,625 --> 01:54:32,423
- Just Doss?
- Just Doss.

1252
01:54:32,505 --> 01:54:34,974
Yeah, Doss, the coward.

1253
01:55:51,065 --> 01:55:54,297
- You're like gum on a shoe, ain't you?
- Give me this.

1254
01:55:54,385 --> 01:55:56,775
It's a bit late for target
practice now, don't you think?

1255
01:56:01,025 --> 01:56:02,982
- Jump on it.
- You're kidding.

1256
01:56:03,065 --> 01:56:04,863
No, I'm going to drag you.

1257
01:56:09,825 --> 01:56:10,975
Let's do it.

1258
01:56:13,665 --> 01:56:14,894
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1259
01:56:14,985 --> 01:56:15,975
Let's go.

1260
01:56:20,945 --> 01:56:22,345
We got company.

1261
01:56:22,425 --> 01:56:23,984
Come on.

1262
01:56:44,425 --> 01:56:45,939
Arms up.

1263
01:56:47,305 --> 01:56:48,864
You gotta be kidding me, Corn Stalk.

1264
01:56:48,945 --> 01:56:50,777
"You're tying a bowline, boy,
not building a bra."

1265
01:56:52,225 --> 01:56:53,818
Come on.

1266
01:56:56,505 --> 01:56:57,700
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

1267
01:56:57,785 --> 01:56:59,060
Get on.

1268
01:57:25,785 --> 01:57:28,061
- Put me down!
- Yes, Sarge.

1269
01:57:28,145 --> 01:57:30,705
- Sergeant Howell.
- Doss is still up there.

1270
01:57:32,385 --> 01:57:34,695
- What the hell?
- He's got Japs on his tail.

1271
01:58:06,705 --> 01:58:07,934
We got him.

1272
01:58:08,025 --> 01:58:09,823
That's good. That's good.

1273
01:58:09,905 --> 01:58:11,897
It's okay, we got him.

1274
01:58:16,825 --> 01:58:18,418
Whoa, whoa...

1275
01:58:18,505 --> 01:58:21,304
- It's okay, Doss.
- Come on, Doss, come on.

1276
01:58:21,385 --> 01:58:24,059
- You're safe.
- Come on, Doss.

1277
01:58:40,305 --> 01:58:42,820
Desmond, it's all right, it's all right.

1278
01:58:44,265 --> 01:58:45,585
Desmond.

1279
01:58:47,745 --> 01:58:50,658
Easy, easy. Here, come on.

1280
01:58:56,665 --> 01:58:58,065
Are you wounded?

1281
01:58:59,225 --> 01:59:01,057
Mmm...

1282
01:59:02,585 --> 01:59:04,463
No. No.

1283
01:59:07,025 --> 01:59:09,665
Let's get this soldier
to a hospital tent, right now.

1284
01:59:09,745 --> 01:59:12,214
- Come on, easy now.
- Easy, easy.

1285
01:59:12,305 --> 01:59:13,534
Make some space.

1286
01:59:56,825 --> 01:59:59,340
We need someone
to come and clean up in here.

1287
02:00:01,465 --> 02:00:02,899
Where's Irv?

1288
02:00:02,985 --> 02:00:05,784
- Irv? You mean, Schecter the medic?
- Yeah.

1289
02:00:05,865 --> 02:00:09,063
He didn't make it.
He died of shock. No plasma.

1290
02:00:10,825 --> 02:00:11,941
Sorry.

1291
02:00:47,465 --> 02:00:50,742
All I saw was a skinny kid.
I didn't know who you were.

1292
02:00:55,585 --> 02:00:57,463
You've done more than
any other man could have done

1293
02:00:57,585 --> 02:00:59,941
in the service of his country.

1294
02:01:00,025 --> 02:01:02,540
And I have never been more wrong
about someone in my life.

1295
02:01:04,145 --> 02:01:06,137
I hope one day you can forgive me.

1296
02:01:18,865 --> 02:01:20,982
We have to go back up tomorrow.

1297
02:01:23,705 --> 02:01:26,345
I realize that tomorrow is your Sabbath.

1298
02:01:32,545 --> 02:01:34,935
Most of these men
don't believe the same way you do.

1299
02:01:36,945 --> 02:01:41,178
But they believe so much
in how much you believe.

1300
02:01:44,345 --> 02:01:47,224
And what you did on that ridge,
it's nothing short of a miracle,

1301
02:01:47,345 --> 02:01:49,064
and they want a piece of it.

1302
02:01:51,985 --> 02:01:54,056
And they're not going
to go up there without you.

1303
02:02:05,385 --> 02:02:07,104
<i>What the hell is your delay, Captain?</i>

1304
02:02:07,185 --> 02:02:08,938
<i>You were supposed to begin
that assault 10 minutes ago!</i>

1305
02:02:09,025 --> 02:02:11,824
- We're waiting, sir.
- Waiting for what?

1306
02:02:14,465 --> 02:02:17,299
For Private Doss
to finish praying for us, sir.

1307
02:02:17,385 --> 02:02:19,024
<i>Private Doss is praying for you?</i>

1308
02:02:19,105 --> 02:02:20,903
<i>Who the hell is Private Doss?</i>

1309
02:02:42,665 --> 02:02:43,894
Let's go to work.

1310
02:04:37,865 --> 02:04:39,697
Down. Get down!

1311
02:04:39,785 --> 02:04:43,142
Get on the ground. On the ground. Now!

1312
02:05:22,785 --> 02:05:24,742
Lay down, lay down. I got the morphine.

1313
02:05:26,385 --> 02:05:28,297
Let's go, let's get these men out of here.

1314
02:05:33,985 --> 02:05:38,059
My Bible... My Bible.
My Bible...

1315
02:05:38,145 --> 02:05:40,899
Stop. Stop, stop, stop. Stop!

1316
02:05:40,985 --> 02:05:43,500
My Bible, my Bible, my Bible.

1317
02:05:44,425 --> 02:05:45,461
Okay.

1318
02:07:00,865 --> 02:07:04,779
You're going home, Desmond.
We've taken Hacksaw.

1319
02:07:08,905 --> 02:07:11,101
Hold up, hold up! Desmond!

1320
02:07:13,225 --> 02:07:14,375
Desmond.

1321
02:09:01,305 --> 02:09:04,423
<i>I was praying the whole time.</i>

1322
02:09:04,505 --> 02:09:09,739
I just kept praying,
"Lord, please help me get one more."

1323
02:09:09,825 --> 02:09:14,945
When I got this, I said,
"Lord, please help me get one more."

1324
02:09:21,025 --> 02:09:23,460
<i>I would say anyone is wrong</i>

1325
02:09:23,545 --> 02:09:25,502
<i>to try to compromise
somebody's conviction.</i>

1326
02:09:25,585 --> 02:09:28,703
I don't care whether
it's army or what it is.

1327
02:09:28,785 --> 02:09:33,177
When you own a conviction,
that is not a joke.

1328
02:09:34,585 --> 02:09:36,224
That's what you are.

1329
02:09:37,705 --> 02:09:39,936
<i>Even though I said those things to him</i>

1330
02:09:40,065 --> 02:09:41,294
<i>in regard to carrying a rifle,</i>

1331
02:09:41,385 --> 02:09:47,985
then he would never be by my
damn side at all unless he had a rifle.

1332
02:09:48,065 --> 02:09:50,944
<i>But then, in the long run,</i>

1333
02:09:51,025 --> 02:09:55,736
<i>finding out that he was one
of the bravest persons alive.</i>

1334
02:09:55,825 --> 02:09:58,579
And then to have him end up saving my life

1335
02:09:58,665 --> 02:10:01,817
was the irony of the whole thing.

1336
02:10:01,905 --> 02:10:06,980
Blood had run down
into the fella's face and eyes.

1337
02:10:07,225 --> 02:10:11,105
He was laying there just
groaning and calling for a medic.

1338
02:10:12,425 --> 02:10:15,296
I took water from my canteen,

1339
02:10:15,496 --> 02:10:19,457
got some bandage,
and I washed his face.

1340
02:10:19,545 --> 02:10:24,381
And when I... was washing his eyes,
his eyes came open.

1341
02:10:24,465 --> 02:10:28,141
Man, he just lit up.

1342
